# Insurance Implementation Plan for Zero Finance

## üìã Overview

Implement a "social contract" insurance system where select users can be marked as "insured" through direct contact with Zero Finance, removing DeFi risk warnings from their experience.

## üéØ Core Concept

- **Default**: All users see insurance warnings
- **Insured Mode**: Users email raghav@0.finance or book a call to get insured status
- **Lite Mode**: Can be used for real funds migration (self-hosted with proper setup)

---

## 1. Insurance Activation Flow

### How Users Get Insured:

```
User sees warning ‚Üí Contacts Zero Finance via:
  ‚Ä¢ Email: raghav@0.finance
  ‚Ä¢ Call: https://cal.com/team/0finance/15
‚Üí Zero Finance sends activation link
‚Üí Warnings removed permanently
```

### Warning Component Design:

```typescript
// Shows on dashboard, savings, deposits
<InsuranceWarning>
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Not insured 

  Want insurance coverage?
  ‚Ä¢ Email: raghav@0.finance
  ‚Ä¢ Book call: [Schedule 15 min]
</InsuranceWarning>
```

---

## 2. Self-Hosted Migration Path

### For Power Users Who Want Full Control:

**Migration Process:**

1. Set up lite mode locally (follow LITE_MODE.md)
2. Configure Privy with your own keys
3. Add yourself as owner on existing Safe
4. Transfer funds via Safe UI
5. Run your own insured instance

**This gives users:**

- Full self-custody
- Real funds management
- No dependency on Zero Finance hosting
- Complete control over insurance

## 3. README.md Updates

```markdown
# 0 Finance

## Benefits Summary

This proposal creates a transparent insurance system where:

1. **Everyone starts uninsured** with clear warnings
2. **Insurance requires human contact** (email/call)
3. **Self-hosting is possible** for power users
4. **Lite mode serves dual purpose** (dev + production)
5. **No hidden complexity** - just a boolean flag

The system protects Zero Finance legally while offering flexibility for different user types - from casual users who want insurance, to power users who want full control.
