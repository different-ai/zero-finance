Can you please provide a detailed plan for your GTM once you’re online?
E.g specific deals with specific KOL’s, marketing with founders
Where do you expect most of the customer acquisition to come from?


Most of it will be IRL tactcits that have yielded results in the past. We regular get 2-3 calls from events we attend IRL. We also have partnerships and there's 3 in particular:

- Request Network (and Finance) that have sent us one of our early grants when we wewrge still exploring.
- Gnosis Pay (e're ex employee) and will have early talks this week on how we can help them with their yield offering.
- Orange DAO and residence.xyz where we'd use the product.


In core we setting up the core GTM to get direct usage on the web app (e.g. our orange dao and residence) and to start mapping out the api partners wi tnsois pay and request network.

That's just laying the foundation, but all of thse provide tangible traction and reach to reach bigger audiences.

On top of that we're also looking into partnering with defi protocols like origin protocol (still early talks) where we'd on their vaults and insurance coverage and help redierct users to their products.
