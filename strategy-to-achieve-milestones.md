# Strategy to Achieve Milestones

We're building in three phases:

**Phase 1** – Prove the core product and revenue model

**Phase 2** – Scale through distribution and card-led usage

**Phase 3** – Make the platform/API the primary revenue driver

Today we are firmly in Phase 1.

---

## Phase 1 – Core Product & Revenue Proof (0–12 months)

Right now the product is a bundling of three core pieces:

**Yield** — Access to DeFi vaults that generate attractive returns

**Safety** — Risk management via insurance coverage

**UX** — Seamless on/off-ramp, embedded wallets, and a simple interface

### What we need to build next

To prove the core revenue model, we need to:

**Expand yield access**
- Go multi-chain to unlock better yields and diversification (beyond Base to Ethereum, Arbitrum, etc.)

**Strengthen safety**
- Go beyond just insurance and start diversifying across vaults (e.g., across Morpho Vaults and eventually across protocols)

**Upgrade UX for real usage**
- Add quality-of-life features like auto-sweep (via Plaid) so cash automatically flows between checking and savings
- Go live with cards infrastructure (e.g., via Gnosis Pay or Rain) so users can actually spend from the product, not just park money

### Core technical milestones for this phase:
- Multi-chain deployment
- Cards infrastructure live
- Auto-sweep with Plaid integration
- Multi-vault diversification

### How we'll get adoption

On the distribution side, we'll:
- Activate partnerships from existing conversations with accelerators and other partners
- Double down on IRL tactics that already work: crashing demo days, SF Tech Week guerrilla marketing, and high-intent founder/operator channels

### What success looks like in Phase 1

Phase 1 is about proving that this product and revenue model work at meaningful scale.

**12-month target (end of Phase 1):**
- $2.5M ARR
  - ~72% from Direct Yield
  - ~20% from Interchange
  - ~8% from API (early platform usage)
- 1,000 businesses
- $200K average deposit
- $200M AUM

At this point, the bulk of revenue still comes from direct yield on deposits, with cards and early API usage starting to show up in the mix.

## Phase 2 – Distribution Leverage & Card Scale (12–24 months)

Once the core product and revenue model are working, Phase 2 is about turning a good product into a scaled distribution machine.

### Strategy

Make us the default high-yield operating account for thousands of businesses

**Use distribution leverage from:**
- Accelerator pipelines
- Fintech and B2B partners
- Word-of-mouth from founders and operators who already use us

**Drive much higher card adoption and spend** so we earn more interchange on top of yield

Technically, Phase 2 continues what we started in Phase 1:
- More chains, more vaults, better routing across them
- More mature card stack and controls
- The API layer exists, but is still in "early partners" mode rather than fully dominant

### What success looks like in Phase 2

**24-month target (end of Phase 2):**
- $25M ARR
  - 36% Direct Yield
  - 32% Interchange
  - 32% Platform (API) Fees
- 3,000 businesses
- $333K average deposit
- $1B AUM
- 80% of customers use cards, with card spend ≈ 1x deposits

By the end of Phase 2:
- We still earn meaningful yield-based revenue
- Card spend and interchange become a major share of revenue
- API is no longer experimental — early partners are live and contributing a third of ARR

This phase is the bridge between "nice product with yield" and "infrastructure other fintechs plug into."

## Phase 3 – Platform as the Primary Revenue Driver (24–36 months)

Phase 3 is where we become the Stripe/Plaid for high-yield savings.

### Strategy

We move from:
- Earning mostly on our own AUM → to earning heavily on everyone else's AUM flowing through our rails

To do that, we:

**Ship and harden a simple API layer** that any fintech can use to:
- Offer our yields
- Bundle in our safety (insurance + diversification)
- Integrate with their own UX and card stacks

**Double down on:**
- AUM growth in the core product (social proof and trust)
- Sales and partnerships to bring API partners live across neobanks, B2B fintechs, vertical SaaS, and treasury platforms

### What success looks like in Phase 3

**36-month target (end of Phase 3):**
- $75M ARR
  - 24% Direct Yield
  - 27% Interchange
  - 49% Platform (API) Fees
- 5,000 businesses
- $400K average deposit
- $2B AUM
- Major API partners live and scaling

At this point:
- Direct yield is still important but no longer the main driver
- Interchange is large and stable as card usage is entrenched
- API revenue dominates — we earn on flows across our partners' AUM, not just our own balance sheet
