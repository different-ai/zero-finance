## Their Current Operations & Pain Points

### Workflow Overview

- **90% of clients use QuickBooks Online**
- Work is handled by a mixed onshore/offshore team (Philippines)
- Offshore talent earns $5-8/hour
- Junior staff handle most categorization work (3-5 hours per "light" client monthly)
- Light clients = 100-300 transactions per month

### Current Manual Processes

1. **Transaction Categorization** (3rd-4th week of month)
   - Manually categorizing bank and credit card transactions
   - QuickBooks rules are set up manually as recurring patterns emerge
   - Most time-consuming part of their workflow

2. **Client Communication** (1st week of following month)
   - Emailing clients with open items
   - Handling non-recurring/new transactions

3. **Reconciliation & Adjustments**
   - Manual payroll journal entries for non-integrated systems
   - Variance analysis
   - Financial statement review

4. **Manager Review**
   - Supervisory review of all work
   - Client meetings and financial discussions

### Key Challenge: Offshore Team Knowledge Gap

Their offshore team lacks context on US vendors/merchants:

- Team members don't recognize common US brands (Best Buy, Exxon, etc.)
- Currently use ChatGPT manually: copy transactions to Excel → paste into ChatGPT → get categorization suggestions
- This is still a manual, time-consuming process

### What They've Explored

**Attempted Solution:** Evaluated a ChatGPT wrapper tool for automated categorization

- **Cost:** $45-50/client/month (without implementation fees)
- **Problem:** More expensive than offshore labor
  - AI tool: $50/hour effective rate
  - Offshore junior: $5-8/hour
  - For light clients (3-5 hours/month), AI was not cost-effective

**Result:** Didn't pursue because cost-benefit analysis didn't make sense

## Their AI Automation Goals

Based on July 2024 conversation, Seafarer wants to:

1. **Streamline workflows** - particularly categorization and reconciliation
2. **Offer real-time reporting** to clients
3. **Scale operations** without linear headcount growth
4. **Reduce manual work** for offshore team while maintaining quality
5. **Test AI solutions** via pilot programs with select clients

### Team Structure They Want to Preserve

- **Controller/CPA** - Highest level supervisory review
- **Accounting Manager** - Client interface, handles 10-15 clients with support
- **Junior Staff** - Day-to-day work (this is where AI could help most)

## Our Relationship with Seafarer

### Timeline

- **June 17, 2024:** Sameer Essa (Fractional CFO) reached out via LinkedIn after seeing my YC post
- **June 26, 2024:** Initial discovery call with Sameer, Hasan Ali (CEO), Meg (Accounting Manager), and Pat (Operations Manager)
- **July 1, 2024:** CEO confirmed interest in pilot program
- **July 2, 2024:** Discussed building pilot brief together
- **July 9, 2024:** Detailed demo call with full team
- **August 2024:** Made intro for fundraising opportunity (ongoing relationship)

### What We Showed Them

Demo of our AI categorization/reconciliation platform:

- Email/document ingestion and parsing
- Plain English rules engine
- Auto-categorization with confidence scores
- Activity log tracking AI vs human decisions
- CSV export capabilities

### Their Feedback

- Very interested in beta testing
- Wanted to identify specific "noisy" clients for pilot
- CEO (Hasan) committed to finding 1-2 test clients
- Team was hands-on and engaged during demo
- Appreciated the plain language rules approach

### Current Status

- **Open to pilot:** Yes, CEO approved
- **Timeline:** Discussed but not finalized (pilot brief was meant to be co-created)
- **Client selection:** In progress (they were identifying suitable test clients)
- **Integration needs:** QuickBooks integration would be valuable but CSV export acceptable for pilot

## Why Seafarer is a Great Fit for Mediar

1. **High volume of manual data entry** - Exactly what you're solving
2. **Cost-conscious** - Tried AI before but it was too expensive
3. **Proven interest in automation** - Already exploring AI solutions
4. **Scale potential** - 100+ clients = large addressable opportunity
5. **Offshore team** - Your tool could bridge knowledge gaps
6. **Legacy system users** - Many clients likely use systems beyond just QuickBooks
7. **Beta-friendly** - Eager to test new solutions and provide feedback

## Key Contacts

- **Hasan Ali** - CEO, decision maker, operations focused
- **Sameer Essa** - Fractional CFO, initial contact, strategic partner
- **Meg Datu** - Accounting Manager, hands-on workflow expert
- **Patrizha Arceo** - Operations Manager, day-to-day processes

## Potential Collaboration Model

Based on our discussions:

1. Start with 1-2 "noisy" clients (high transaction volume)
2. Focus on categorization and reconciliation loops
3. Lightweight pilot with easy exit
4. Direct feedback loop with their team
5. Goal: Shave hours off manual work without adding complexity
6. Expand to more clients if successful
