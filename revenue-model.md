# Revenue Model

It all comes down to 3 sources:
- Direct Yield — Basis points on customer deposits
- Interchange — 1% on card transactions
- Platform Fees — Basis points on API partner AUM + integration fees

The core revenue source is taking fractions on the yield we generate. We take 10% of the yield. At 9% yield, that's 90 basis points on deposits. On $10M in deposits at 9%, we generate $900K for the customer and keep $90K.

We also capture interchange on card spend—1% of every transaction. When customers spend through our corporate cards, we earn on the transaction while they still earn yield on their balance.

For API partners, we charge the same way—basis points on AUM flowing through our infrastructure, plus integration fees.
