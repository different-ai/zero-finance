# Tech Stack & IP

## IP Rights & Licensing

**Does the company license any IP rights necessary to build and offer its actual and proposed products? If yes, what other parties have a license to or right to use this IP? Has the company received any correspondence threatening an IP dispute?**

We do not license any proprietary IP rights. Our web application is open source (MIT license). Our future backend services will use standard commercial licenses. We have received no correspondence threatening any IP disputes.

## Tech Stack

**Current stack:**
- **Web app:** React/Next.js
- **Smart contracts:** Solidity (audited third-party contracts)
- **Embedded wallets:** Privy
- **On/off-ramping:** Align Labs
- **Yield infrastructure:** Morpho (audited high-yield smart contracts)
- **Multi-sig wallets:** Gnosis Safe
- **Chain:** Base

This stack will evolve as we scale. We plan to expand to additional chains, integrate with multiple yield vaults, and develop custom smart contracts for cross-chain fund movement and more complex treasury operations.

## Security Audits

**Have you engaged any third parties to conduct a code design and security audit? If so, please share the reports/documentation.**

Not yet. We're currently using battle-tested, audited off-the-shelf smart contracts from established protocols (Morpho, Gnosis Safe).

As we develop custom smart contracts—particularly for cross-chain fund movement and advanced treasury operations—we will conduct comprehensive third-party security audits before deployment. This is standard practice and critical for managing customer funds at scale.
