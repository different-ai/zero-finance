## What is 0 Finance?

0 Finance is a bank account built for the AI era:

- **Get paid easily** — Create invoices in seconds and receive payments to your personal IBAN or ACH account.
- **Spend anywhere** — Use a debit card worldwide with 0% conversion fees.
- **Optimize yield** — AI automatically allocates idle funds to the highest-yielding opportunities.

Everything is programmable through the **`finance` CLI** (aliases: `0`, `zero`) — check balances, send invoices, propose transfers, and manage savings from your terminal.

## What you can do

### Check your balance

```bash
finance balance
```

```json
{
  "usdc_balance": "7420.50",
  "safe_address": "0x954A329e1e59101DF529CC54A54666A0b36Cae22",
  "chain": "base"
}
```

### Create and send invoices

```bash
# Create an invoice
finance invoices create \
  --recipient-email client@acme.com \
  --recipient-name "Acme Corp" \
  --amount 2500 \
  --currency USD \
  --description "Q1 consulting"

# Send it
finance invoices send --invoice-id inv_xxx
```

### Propose a bank transfer

```bash
# List your saved bank accounts
finance bank accounts list

# Propose a transfer (requires dashboard approval)
finance bank transfers propose \
  --amount 1000 \
  --currency usd \
  --bank-account-id ba_xxx \
  --reason "Contractor payment"
```

### Manage savings

```bash
# View available vaults
finance vaults list

# Deposit into a yield vault
finance savings deposits propose \
  --vault-address 0x... \
  --amount 500 \
  --reason "Earning yield on idle funds"

# Check your positions
finance savings positions
```

## How it works

1. **Authenticate** — Use `finance auth connect` (or `finance auth login` with an API key).
2. **Execute commands** — Read operations happen instantly. Transfers and withdrawals create proposals.
3. **Approve in dashboard** — Proposals require human approval before executing. This keeps you in control.

<Info>
  The CLI never moves money without your explicit approval in the 0 Finance
  dashboard.

## For AI agents

Connect your AI assistant to 0 Finance using the MCP server. Your agent can check balances, create invoices, and propose transfers — but all outbound payments still require your approval.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zero-finance": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://0.finance/api/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "sk_live_xxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
  MCP currently supports bank transfers, invoices, attachments, and payment
  details. For crypto transfers and savings, use the CLI or HTTP API.

See [MCP setup](/mcp/overview) for detailed instructions.
