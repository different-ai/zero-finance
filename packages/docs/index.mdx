## What is 0 Finance?

0 Finance is a bank account built for the AI era:

- **Get paid easily** — Create invoices in seconds and receive payments to your personal IBAN or ACH account.
- **Spend anywhere** — Use a debit card worldwide with 0% conversion fees.
- **Optimize yield** — AI automatically allocates idle funds to the highest-yielding opportunities.

Everything is programmable through the **`zero` CLI** — check balances, send invoices, propose transfers, and manage savings from your terminal.

## Quick start

```bash
# Install the CLI
pnpm add -g @zero-finance/cli

# Create and send an invoice
zero invoices create \
  --recipient-email client@example.com \

  --currency USD \
  --description "Consulting services"
```

## What you can do

### Check your balance

```bash
zero balance
```

```json
{
  "spendable_usdc": "5420.50",
  "pending_usdc": "0.00",
  "earning_usdc": "2000.00",
  "total_usdc": "7420.50"
}
```

### Create and send invoices

```bash
# Create an invoice
zero invoices create \
  --recipient-email client@acme.com \
  --recipient-name "Acme Corp" \
  --amount 2500 \
  --currency USD \
  --description "Q1 consulting"

# Send it
zero invoices send --invoice-id inv_xxx
```

### Propose a bank transfer

```bash
# List your saved bank accounts
zero bank accounts list

# Propose a transfer (requires dashboard approval)
zero bank transfers propose \
  --amount 1000 \
  --currency usd \
  --bank-account-id ba_xxx \
  --reason "Contractor payment"
```

### Manage savings

```bash
# View available vaults
zero vaults list

# Deposit into a yield vault
zero savings deposits propose \
  --vault-address 0x... \
  --amount 500 \
  --reason "Earning yield on idle funds"

# Check your positions
zero savings positions
```

## How it works

1. **Authenticate** — Use `zero auth login` with your API key from the dashboard.
2. **Execute commands** — All read operations happen instantly. Write operations (transfers, withdrawals) create proposals.
3. **Approve in dashboard** — Proposals require human approval before executing. This keeps you in control.

<Info>
  The CLI never moves money without your explicit approval in the 0 Finance
  dashboard.

## For AI agents

Connect your AI assistant to 0 Finance using the MCP server. Your agent can check balances, create invoices, and propose transfers — but all outbound payments still require your approval.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zero-finance": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://0.finance/api/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "sk_live_xxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See [MCP setup](/mcp/overview) for detailed instructions.
