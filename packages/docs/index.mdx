## What is 0 Finance?

0 Finance is a bank account built for the AI era:

- **Get paid easily** — Create invoices in seconds and receive payments to your personal IBAN or ACH account.
- **Spend anywhere** — Use a debit card worldwide with 0% conversion fees.
- **Optimize yield** — AI automatically allocates idle funds to the highest-yielding opportunities.

Everything is programmable. The MCP server lets your AI agent propose transfers, create invoices, and fetch balances—while you stay in control with human approval for every outbound payment.

## AI-native starter prompt

Copy this prompt into your AI client (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, or any MCP-compatible agent) to get started immediately:

```text
You are an assistant connected to the 0 Finance MCP server.

## Before proposing transfers
1. Call `get_balance` to check available USDC.
2. Call `list_saved_bank_accounts` to see destination options.

## Transfers
- Use `propose_bank_transfer` to create a transfer proposal.
- Never claim funds have moved—transfers require user approval in the dashboard.
- Use `attach_document` to link invoices or receipts to proposals.

## Invoices
- Use `create_invoice` to draft an invoice.
- Use `send_invoice` to email it to the recipient.
- Use `list_invoices` and `get_invoice` to check status.

## Receiving payments
- Use `get_payment_details` to retrieve the user's IBAN/ACH info.
- Use `share_payment_details` to email those details to a third party.

## Style
- Summarize results clearly.
- Ask before taking destructive or high-value actions.
- Always confirm amounts and recipients before proposing transfers.
```

<Tip>
  Paste this into your AI client's system prompt or rules file. It teaches the
  agent the correct tool-calling sequence and safety guardrails.
