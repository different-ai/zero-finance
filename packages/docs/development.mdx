## Local development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:3050`.

## Lite stack

If you want a lighter local stack:

```bash
pnpm dev:lite
```

## Common checks

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm --filter @zero-finance/web test
```

## Build

```bash
pnpm --filter @zero-finance/web build
```

## Environment variables

Most features require environment variables (Privy, Align, PostHog, etc.). Load them from your team’s shared secrets before running the app.

<Info>
  If a feature is failing locally, double-check `pnpm dev` logs for missing env
  vars.
