Claude Code can call the 0 Finance MCP server to fetch balances, create invoices, and propose transfers.

## MCP endpoint

- URL: `https://www.0.finance/api/mcp`
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`

## Configure Claude Code

Add a remote MCP server in your Claude Code MCP settings using the URL and header above.

Example configuration (adapt to your setup):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "zero-finance": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://www.0.finance/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage tips

- Always propose transfers; users must approve them in the dashboard.
- Use `list_saved_bank_accounts` before proposing a transfer.
- Use `get_payment_details` to share inbound payment info.
