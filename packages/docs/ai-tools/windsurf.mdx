Windsurf’s Cascade assistant can use MCP to access 0 Finance tools with your permission.

## MCP endpoint

- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`

## Configure Windsurf

Add a remote MCP server in Windsurf with the URL and auth header above.

Example configuration (adapt to your MCP settings format):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "0-finance": {
      "url": "https://www.0.finance/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Suggested flows

- Fetch balances before proposing transfers.
- Create invoices, then `send_invoice` to email them.
- Attach documents using `attach_document` after proposals are created.
