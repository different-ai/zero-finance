description: 'Connect Claude Code to the 0 Finance MCP server'
---

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) or Claude Desktop installed
- 0 Finance API key from [Settings → API Keys](https://0.finance/settings)

---

## Step 1: Create the config file

Create or edit `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zero-finance": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://0.finance/api/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "sk_live_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Step 2: Restart Claude

Quit and reopen Claude to load the new MCP server.

---

## Step 3: Verify

Ask Claude to check your balance:

```
Check my 0 Finance balance
```

Claude should call `get_balance` and display your USDC balance.

---

## Add to CLAUDE.md

For project-specific context, add this to your `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## 0 Finance Integration

This project uses 0 Finance for payments. When working with finances:

- Use `get_balance` before proposing transfers
- Transfers require dashboard approval—never claim funds moved
- Use `create_invoice` for billing clients
- Use `get_payment_details` to share receiving info
```

## Troubleshooting

### "MCP server not found"

1. Check that `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json` exists
2. Verify the JSON is valid (no trailing commas)
3. Restart Claude completely (quit and reopen)

### "Tool execution failed"

1. Verify your API key is valid
2. Check the Claude output for specific error messages
3. Ensure you have network connectivity

### Slow responses

The MCP server connects over HTTPS. If responses are slow:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Try a different network
3. The first request may be slower due to npx package download
