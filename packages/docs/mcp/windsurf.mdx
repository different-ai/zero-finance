description: 'Connect Windsurf to the 0 Finance MCP server'
---

## Prerequisites

- [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) installed
- 0 Finance API key from [Settings → API Keys](https://0.finance/settings)

---

## Step 1: Create the config file

Create or edit `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zero-finance": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://0.finance/api/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "sk_live_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Step 2: Restart Windsurf

Quit and reopen Windsurf to load the new MCP server.

---

## Step 3: Verify

In Cascade, ask Windsurf to check your balance:

```
Check my 0 Finance balance
```

Windsurf should call `get_balance` and display your USDC balance.
