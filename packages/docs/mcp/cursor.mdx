title: 'Cursor'
description: 'Connect Cursor to the 0 Finance MCP server'
---

## Prerequisites

- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) installed
- 0 Finance API key from [Settings → API Keys](https://0.finance/settings)

---

## Step 1: Create the config file

Create or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zero-finance": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://0.finance/api/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "sk_live_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Step 2: Restart Cursor

Quit and reopen Cursor to load the new MCP server.

---

## Step 3: Verify

In a new chat, ask Cursor to check your balance:

```
Check my 0 Finance balance
```

Cursor should call `get_balance` and show your USDC balance.

---

## Add the starter prompt

For best results, add this to your Cursor rules (`.cursorrules` or project settings):

```text
When using 0 Finance tools:
- Always call get_balance before proposing transfers
- Never claim funds have moved—transfers require dashboard approval
- Confirm amounts and recipients before creating proposals
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "MCP server not found"

1. Check that `~/.cursor/mcp.json` exists and is valid JSON
2. Verify `npx` is available in your PATH
3. Restart Cursor

### "Authentication failed"

1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check the key hasn't expired in [Settings → API Keys](https://0.finance/settings)
3. Ensure there are no extra spaces in the key

### "Tool call failed"

Check the Cursor output panel for error messages. Common issues:

- Rate limiting (wait and retry)
- Invalid parameters (check the tool documentation)
- Network issues (verify internet connection)
