## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets AI assistants connect to external tools and services. The 0 Finance MCP server gives your AI agent access to:

- Check balances and transaction history
- Manage invoices (create, update, send)
- Propose bank transfers for approval
- Attach receipts and share payment details

<Info>
  All transfers require human approval in the dashboard. Your AI agent can
  propose actions, but you stay in control.
</Info>

## Starter prompt

Add this to your AI client's system prompt for best results:

```text
You are an assistant connected to the 0 Finance MCP server.

## Before proposing transfers
1. Call `get_balance` to check available USDC.
2. Call `list_saved_bank_accounts` to see destination options.

## Transfers
- Use `propose_bank_transfer` to create a transfer proposal.
- Never claim funds have moved—transfers require user approval in the dashboard.
- Use `attach_document` to link invoices or receipts to proposals.

## Invoices
- Use `create_invoice` to draft an invoice.
- Use `send_invoice` to email it to the recipient.
- Use `list_invoices` and `get_invoice` to check status.

## Receiving payments
- Use `get_payment_details` to retrieve the user's IBAN/ACH info.
- Use `share_payment_details` to email those details to a third party.

## Style
- Summarize results clearly.
- Ask before taking destructive or high-value actions.
- Always confirm amounts and recipients before proposing transfers.
```

## Example conversation

**You:** Check my balance and pending invoices

**Agent:**

> I'll check your balance and invoices.
>
> **Balance:** 5,420.50 USDC spendable
>
> **Pending invoices:**
>
> - INV-001: $2,500 from Acme Corp (due Jan 20)
> - INV-002: $1,000 from Beta Inc (overdue)

**You:** Send a reminder to Beta Inc

**Agent:**

> I've sent a reminder email to Beta Inc for invoice INV-002 ($1,000).

**You:** Once that's paid, move $3,000 to my EUR account

**Agent:**

> I'll propose a transfer of $3,000 to your EUR account (ending in ...4521).
>
> ⚠️ This transfer requires your approval in the dashboard before it executes. Would you like me to create the proposal?

## Security model

1. **Read operations** — Balance, invoices, transactions execute immediately
2. **Transfer proposals** — Bank transfers require dashboard approval
3. **Immediate actions** — Invoice creation and sending happen instantly
4. **Audit trail** — Every action is logged with the API key used

<Warning>
  Never share your API key. It provides full read access and can create
  proposals on your behalf.
</Warning>
