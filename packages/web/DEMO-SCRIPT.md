## Product Walkthrough

_Total demo time: 8-10 minutes_

### Step 1: The Problem

**⏱ 45 seconds**

**Dashboard shows: Empty state**

> "This is Zero Finance. Right now you're looking at an empty account. Let me show you what happens when a startup deposits their treasury."

> "Most startups have $2-3 million sitting in a traditional bank earning essentially nothing - 0.1% APY. That's a massive opportunity cost."

---

### Step 2: Empty Dashboard

**⏱ 30 seconds**

**Dashboard shows: Zero balance, clean interface**

> "The interface is intentionally simple. No complex terminology, no confusing charts. Everything is in USD."

> "You can see your balance, current APY rate, and earnings - all at a glance."

---

### Step 3: Fund Your Account

**⏱ 60 seconds**

**Dashboard shows: Deposit interface appears**

> "Funding works like any bank transfer. You wire money from Chase, Mercury, or wherever you bank today."

> "The deposit screen shows standard wire instructions - routing number, account number. Exactly what you're used to."

> "Funds typically arrive same day for wires, 1-2 days for ACH."

---

### Step 4: Funds Received

**⏱ 60 seconds**

**Dashboard shows: Balance updates to $2,500,000**

> "Your funds just arrived. Watch the balance - $2.5 million is now in the account."

> "Look at the yield counter starting to tick. You're earning $547 per day. That's happening in real-time."

> "No configuration needed. The moment your money arrives, it starts earning 8% APY automatically."

---

### Step 5: Your Dashboard

**⏱ 45 seconds**

**Dashboard shows: Full dashboard with balance and earnings**

> "This is what you see when you log in each day. Your balance: $2.5 million. Today's earnings: $547."

> "The yield accumulates every second and compounds automatically."

> "Everything is transparent - you can see exactly what you're earning and when."

---

### Step 6: Maximize Savings

**⏱ 90 seconds**

**Dashboard automatically navigates to Savings page**
**Shows: Savings allocation interface with $2.5M in 8% APY vault**

> "The system automatically moved to the Savings view. Here you can see your $2.5 million allocated to the 8% APY vault."

> "Daily yield: $547.95. Monthly: $16,667. Annual: $200,000."

> "For a startup with a $200k monthly burn rate, this yield alone extends runway by 12 full months. That's an extra year without dilution."

---

### Step 7: Withdrawals

**⏱ 45 seconds**

**Dashboard shows: Withdrawal interface**

> "Need to pay salaries or vendors? Withdrawals are simple."

> "Enter the amount, select your bank, confirm. Money arrives in 1-2 business days."

> "No penalties, no waiting periods. You keep earning yield until the moment the transfer completes."

---

### Step 8: What's Coming

**⏱ 60 seconds**

**Dashboard shows: Current features and roadmap**

> "Today, Zero gives you 8% APY on idle cash with complete liquidity."

> "Coming in Q1 2025: Corporate cards that spend directly from your yield-earning balance."

> "Also coming: Bill pay integration and automated tax forms."

> "The goal is simple - help startups extend runway without raising more capital."

---

## Common Questions

_After demo completion_

### "How is 8% APY possible?"

> "The yield comes from institutional DeFi lending protocols. Large traders borrow USDC and pay interest. We make those rates accessible to startups through a simple interface."

### "Is this FDIC insured?"

> "No, this isn't a traditional bank account. It's a non-custodial wallet earning yield through smart contracts. Many startups start with 10-20% of treasury to test it out."

### "How quickly can I withdraw?"

> "ACH transfers take 1-2 business days. You continue earning yield until the transfer completes."

### "What are the risks?"

> "Smart contract risk and USDC stability risk. The protocols we use have been audited and battle-tested with billions in deposits."

### "Who else uses this?"

> "Startups who want to extend runway without raising more capital. Even allocating 20% of treasury to 8% APY can add 2-3 months of runway."

## Key Numbers to Remember

- **$2.5M at 0.1% APY:** $2,500/year (basically nothing)
- **$2.5M at 8.0% APY:** $200,000/year
- **Difference:** $197,500/year = 12 months of runway at $200k/month burn
- **Daily earnings at 8%:** $547
- **Time to setup:** 2 minutes
- **Withdrawal time:** 1-2 business days

## Demo Tips

1. Let the numbers speak for themselves
2. Pause on the yield counter - let them watch it tick
3. Keep explanations simple and factual
4. Don't oversell - the 8% APY is compelling enough
5. Focus on runway extension, not investment returns
6. Address risks honestly when asked
