# Multi-Vault Savings Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

### 1. Database Changes
- **Migration File**: `drizzle/0092_add_auto_vault_address.sql`
  - Added `auto_vault_address` column to `auto_earn_configs` table
  - Sets default to Seamless vault for existing configs
- **Schema Update**: Updated `src/db/schema.ts` to include new column

### 2. Backend Infrastructure
- **Vault Constants**: `src/server/earn/base-vaults.ts`
  - Defines 3 Base USDC vaults (Seamless, Gauntlet Core, Steakhouse)
  - Includes metadata: risk levels, curator, Morpho URLs
  
- **New TRPC Endpoints** in `src/server/routers/earn-router.ts`:
  - `statsByVault`: Fetch stats for multiple vaults in parallel
  - `userPositions`: Get user positions across vaults via Morpho GraphQL
  - `setAutoVault`: Set the auto-savings destination vault
  - `getAutoVaultConfig`: Get current auto-vault selection

### 3. Frontend Updates
- **Savings Page**: `src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/savings/page.tsx`
  - Base network branding with logo
  - 3-vault grid display with live stats
  - Auto-savings vault selection
  - Hash-based routing for deposit/withdraw (`#deposit-0x...`, `#withdraw-0x...`)
  - Real-time updates every 10 seconds

### 4. Features Implemented

#### Multi-Vault Display
- Shows 3 USDC vaults on Base network
- Each vault displays:
  - Current balance
  - APY (live from Morpho)
  - Lifetime earnings
  - Risk level and curator
  - Direct deposit/withdraw buttons

#### Auto-Savings Selection
- One vault can be selected as auto-savings destination
- Selection persists to database
- Visual "Auto-savings" badge on selected vault
- Seamless fallback if no vault selected

#### Deposit/Withdraw Routing
- Click deposit/withdraw on any vault card
- Modal opens targeting that specific vault
- Maintains isolation between vaults
- Updates balances after successful transactions

### 5. Safety & Compatibility
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing Seamless deposits continue working
- **Chain Safety**: Always uses Base chain ID (8453)
- **Decimal Handling**: USDC on Base = 6 decimals
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- **Validation**: Only accepts whitelisted Base vault addresses

## üöÄ Next Steps to Deploy

1. **Run Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

2. **Test the Implementation**:
   - Follow the testing checklist in `MULTI_VAULT_TESTING.md`
   - Verify all 3 vaults display correctly
   - Test auto-savings selection persistence
   - Confirm deposit/withdraw routing works

3. **Monitor After Deploy**:
   - Check GraphQL API responses for vault stats
   - Verify auto-earn triggers use selected vault
   - Monitor for any console errors

## üìä Technical Details

### Vault Addresses on Base
- **Seamless USDC**: `0x616a4E1db48e22028f6bbf20444Cd3b8e3273738` (Balanced)
- **Gauntlet USDC Core**: `0xc0c5689e6f4D256E861F65465b691aeEcC0dEb12` (Conservative)
- **Steakhouse USDC**: `0xbeeF010f9cb27031ad51e3333f9aF9C6B1228183` (Balanced)

### Data Flow
1. User selects auto-vault ‚Üí Saved to `auto_earn_configs.auto_vault_address`
2. Page loads ‚Üí Fetches positions from Morpho GraphQL
3. Stats computed ‚Üí Principal, current value, yield calculated per vault
4. Auto-earn triggers ‚Üí Uses selected vault address for deposits

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel fetching of vault stats
- 10-second cache for positions
- Progressive loading of vault cards
- Optimistic UI updates on mutations

## üîí Security Considerations
- Safe ownership verified on all operations
- Vault addresses validated against whitelist
- Checksummed addresses throughout
- No direct user input for vault addresses

## üìù Files Changed
1. `drizzle/0092_add_auto_vault_address.sql` - New migration
2. `src/db/schema.ts` - Added autoVaultAddress column
3. `src/server/earn/base-vaults.ts` - New vault constants
4. `src/server/routers/earn-router.ts` - Added 4 new endpoints
5. `src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/savings/page.tsx` - Multi-vault UI
6. `MULTI_VAULT_TESTING.md` - Testing checklist
7. `MULTI_VAULT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## ‚ú® User Experience Improvements
- Clear risk labeling for informed decisions
- One-click vault selection for auto-savings
- Direct links to Morpho for detailed vault info
- Visual feedback for selected auto-vault
- Seamless deposit/withdraw to any vault

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
