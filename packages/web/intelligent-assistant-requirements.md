# Intelligent Financial Assistant Requirements for 0 Finance

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements to transform 0 Finance into an intelligent financial assistant capable of proactive communication, predictive analytics, and automated financial management.

## Current State
0 Finance has established:
- Multi-safe architecture (primary, tax, liquidity, yield)
- AI-powered document processing (invoices, receipts)
- Gmail integration with email classification
- Request Network for blockchain invoicing
- Basic chat interfaces
- Vault/yield management
- Bank account connections

## Target Experience Examples
1. **"Hi Ben, remember you got a payment to do next week. Wanna do it already?"**
2. **"Hey Ben, you're running a bit low on cash. Your current burn rate based on your expenses is $4k"**
3. **"Hey Ben, there's some money unallocated in your vault"**
4. **"Hi Ben, so you're based in California. The state tax is 30%, want me to create a vault that automatically saves money for you?"**
5. **"Hi Ben, I can see we have some uncategorized receipts. Want me to help you with that?"**
6. **"Hi Ben, I'm not quite sure what this payment does. Anything you'd want to change there?"**
7. **"Hi Ben, there's an invoice that just came in and it looks like you might not have enough cash on hand to make a payment by the deadline"**
8. **"Hi Ben, did you file your taxes yet? Let me know if I need to prepare that for you"**
