# Call Outline - Testing Fractional CFO Hypothesis

## Hypothesis Being Tested

**Problem:** Fractional CFOs spend excessive time on reconciliation not because of the accounting work itself, but because they lose time gathering context from clients about unclear transactions and dealing with slow client communication.

**Target:** Firms with 50-100+ clients

---

## Opening Hook (First 30 seconds)

**You:** "Thanks for taking this call. I know Stride manages 100+ clients - that's impressive scale. Before we dive in, can I ask: what's your current role in the reconciliation and bookkeeping process? Are you hands-on or more overseeing?"

_[This immediately qualifies them and sets you up to control the conversation]_

## Take Control & Set Frame (Next 30 seconds)

**You:** "Perfect. So here's what I'm trying to understand - and I might be completely wrong which is why I need your help. I have a hypothesis that firms at your scale spend more time chasing clients for transaction context than doing actual bookkeeping. But maybe you've solved this or it's not even a real problem. Can I ask you a few specific questions about your workflow?"

## Core Validation Questions (10 minutes)

### 1. The Current State Question

**"Walk me through what happened yesterday - how many unclear transactions did your team encounter across all 100+ clients?"**

_Listen for:_

- Actual numbers (proves it's real)
- Emotional reactions (frustration = good signal)
- "We don't track that" (they've accepted the pain)

### 2. The Time Audit Question

**"Pick one of those unclear transactions - let's say 'Wire Transfer 8472' - walk me through step-by-step what happens from when you see it to when it's properly categorized."**

_Dig deeper:_

- "How long does that whole process take?"
- "How many back-and-forths with the client?"
- "What happens if they don't respond?"

### 3. The Scale Breaking Point

**"At what point does this process break? Could you handle 200 clients with your current system? 500?"**

_This reveals:_

- If they want to grow
- What's preventing growth
- If it's the reconciliation bottleneck

### 4. The Workaround Investigation

**"You've been at this scale for a while - what have you already tried to make this faster?"**

_Listen for:_

- Templates (partial solution)
- Dedicated staff (expensive solution)
- "We just deal with it" (accepted pain)
- Automation attempts (validates need)

### 5. The Money Question

**"How many hours per month does your team spend just on client communication about transactions? What's that costing you?"**

_Follow up:_

- "What could you do with those hours instead?"
- "How many more clients could you take on?"

---

## Growth & Scaling Questions (3 minutes)

### 6. The Growth Ambition Test

**"Where do you want Stride to be in 2 years - still at 100 clients or significantly larger?"**

_If they want to grow:_

- "What's stopping you from taking on 50 more clients tomorrow?"
- "Is it finding clients or operational capacity?"

### 7. The Constraint Identifier

**"If reconciliation and categorization was instant and perfect, what would still prevent you from scaling?"**

_This reveals:_

- If reconciliation is THE bottleneck
- Other problems to be aware of
- How important your solution would be

---

## Closing & Commitment Test (2 minutes)

### 8. The Reality Check

**"Based on what you've told me, it sounds like [summarize what you heard]. Is that accurate?"**

### 9. The Commitment Probe

**"If someone could cut your reconciliation time by 60%, what would that be worth to Stride?"**

### 10. The Final Validation

**"On a scale of 1-10, how painful is this problem for you? What would make it a 10?"**

---

## Emergency Pivots

### If they say "not really a problem":

**"Interesting - so when you get unclear transactions, clients respond immediately? Can you show me an example from this week?"**

### If they say "we've solved it":

**"That's exactly what I want to learn - walk me through your solution. How long did it take to implement?"**

### If they're not qualified:

**"Got it - different scale than I'm researching. Who do you know that manages 200+ clients? How do they handle this?"**

## Key Rules for the Call

1. **Never mention your solution** - Even if they ask
2. **Always ask for specifics** - "Yesterday" not "usually"
3. **Dig into emotions** - Frustration validates pain
4. **Get numbers** - Hours, costs, client counts
5. **Control the conversation** - You ask questions, they answer

## Success Metrics

✅ **You've VALIDATED if:**

- They spend 20+ hours/month on transaction clarification
- It's preventing them from scaling
- They've tried and failed to solve it
- Emotional reaction when discussing it

❌ **You've INVALIDATED if:**

- "Clients are really responsive"
- "We have a great system for this"
- "It's maybe 2-3 hours a month"
- "We don't want to grow beyond 100"

## The Hook That Controls

Start EVERY call with: **"Before we dive in, help me understand your scale - you manage 100+ clients, but what does that actually mean in terms of monthly transactions you're processing?"**

This immediately:

- Qualifies them
- Sets you as the questioner
- Gets them talking specifics
- Avoids pitch mode

## Remember

You're not trying to convince them they have a problem. You're trying to learn if they actually do.
