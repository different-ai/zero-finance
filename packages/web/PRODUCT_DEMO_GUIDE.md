# Product Demo Guide: Getting Real Feedback, Not Compliments

## Pre-Demo Setup

### The Right Framing

"I've been working on something based on what I've learned from other fractional CFOs about reconciliation challenges. Before I show you anything, can I understand your current process first?"

**Ask 2-3 specific questions about their workflow BEFORE revealing anything:**

- "How did your last reconciliation go?"
- "What took the most time?"
- "Show me the messiest client transaction list you have"

---

## Demo Strategies That Get Truth, Not Politeness

### 1. The "Broken Demo" Technique

Instead of a polished pitch, show the actual messy problem:

> "Let me show you what a typical fractional CFO sent me last week - 14 transactions they couldn't categorize without client context. How would you handle these?"

_Then show your solution naturally as they engage with the problem_

### 2. The Commitment Checkpoint

After showing each key feature, stop and ask for commitment:

#### After showing AI context questions:

- ❌ **Wrong:** "What do you think?"
- ✅ **Right:** "Would you actually send this exact message to your client, or would you need to change it?"

#### After showing the clarification workflow:

- ❌ **Wrong:** "Is this useful?"
- ✅ **Right:** "How much time would this have saved you on your last client? Can you walk me through a specific example?"

#### After showing categorization:

- ❌ **Wrong:** "Cool, right?"
- ✅ **Right:** "Which of these categorizations would you need to fix before sending to your client?"

### 3. The Reality Check Questions

After showing the demo, ask:

- "What would stop you from using this tomorrow with your most difficult client?"
- "Which client would you try this with first? Why them specifically?"
- "What would have to change about this for you to actually replace your current process?"
- "What's the catch? What am I missing about how you actually work?"

---

## Handling Responses

### When They Say "This is amazing!"

Deflect and dig:

- "Thanks - but let's be specific. Looking at your actual reconciliation from last week, where exactly would this fit in?"
- "Appreciate that - but what's the catch? What am I missing about how you actually work?"
- "Great - so which client are you thinking of? Can we do a trial run with their next reconciliation?"

### When They Give Feature Requests

"It would be perfect if it could also..."

Don't write it down. Instead ask:

- "How are you solving that problem today?"
- "How much time/money does that specific issue cost you?"
- "Would you use it tomorrow even without that feature?"
- "Show me the last time that came up in your actual work"

---

## Closing for Real Commitment

### 🚫 Weak Commitments (Red Flags)

- "Send me info and I'll think about it"
- "This could be really useful someday"
- "I'll mention it to my other CFO friends"
- "Let me know when it's ready"
- "This has potential"

### ✅ Strong Commitments (Green Flags)

- "Can I use this for my month-end close next week?"
- "I have a client reconciliation tomorrow - can we pilot this?"
- "What would it cost to use this for my 5 clients?"
- "Can you add my client John's email so I can test the context request feature?"
- "I need this yesterday - when can I start?"

---

## The Pilot Close Script

> "I'm looking for 3 fractional CFOs to pilot this with their messiest client for free next month. You'd need to:
>
> - Upload real transactions within 48 hours
> - Actually send the context requests to your client
> - Do a 30-minute call with me after to discuss what broke
>
> Is that something you could commit to?"

If they hesitate, they're not really interested.

## Critical Follow-Up Questions

### Immediately after they see it working:

- "What would you do differently if this saved you 2 hours per client per month?"
- "How would you price your reconciliation services if this made them 3x faster?"
- "Which of your current clients would fire you if reconciliation took 50% less time?" _(tests if speed is really valuable)_

### Testing price sensitivity:

- "Some CFOs said they'd pay $500/month for this. That seems crazy high to me - what do you think?"
- "If this cost the same as your QuickBooks subscription, would that work?"
- "What tools do you currently pay for? How does this compare in value?"

---

## The Brutal Honesty Question

End every demo with:

> "Based on what you've seen, give me a number from 0-10 on how likely you are to actually use this next week. What would make it a 10?"

**Scoring guide:**

- **0-6:** They're being polite. It's a no.
- **7:** They're interested but have major concerns
- **8:** They'd use it with some changes
- **9-10:** They're ready to buy

For anything below 8, dig deep:

- "What's the main thing holding you back?"
- "What would have to be different for this to be an 8?"

## Demo Don'ts

1. **Don't explain features** - Let them discover the value
2. **Don't defend your solution** - Accept their criticism gratefully
3. **Don't promise features** - Focus on validating the core problem
4. **Don't pitch benefits** - Let them tell you what's valuable
5. **Don't accept compliments** - Always deflect to specifics

---

## Post-Demo Analysis

### With your team, review:

1. **Engagement Level**

   - Did they lean in or check their phone?
   - Did they ask questions or sit quietly?
   - Did they touch the keyboard/mouse to try it?

2. **Specific Reactions**

   - What exact features made them react?
   - What did they ignore completely?
   - Where did they get confused?

3. **Commitment Level**

   - What specific commitment did they make?
   - When is the next concrete step?
   - What would prevent them from moving forward?

4. **Reality Check**
   - Would they actually pay for this?
   - Is their problem big enough to change their behavior?
   - Are we solving the right problem?

## The Ultimate Test

If they don't ask "When can I use this?" or "How much does it cost?" unprompted, you haven't found product-market fit yet.

Remember: **The goal isn't to get them excited about your vision. It's to see if your solution fits into their actual messy, real-world workflow TODAY.**
