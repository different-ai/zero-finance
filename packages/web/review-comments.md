# Review Notes — Starter Account Automation

- **P0: Starter records block full VA provisioning** — inserting starter funding sources into `user_funding_sources` makes the cron in `src/app/api/cron/virtual-account-sync/route.ts` (and the similar `kyc-notifications` flow) bail early on `existingAccounts.length > 0`, so workspaces never receive full-tier virtual accounts after KYB approval. Update the check to skip only when a `full` tier source exists or write the starter rows in a way those jobs ignore.
- **Fallback for existing workspaces** — workspaces that already received starter rows now lack full-tier accounts. Ship a repair path (one-off backfill or cron fallback) that provisions full accounts for those users once the tier fix lands, and consider an interim guard in the banking instructions UI to auto-provision a starter account when a workspace still shows zero funding sources.
- **Legacy user migration** — users who created accounts before the starter account feature was deployed have no virtual accounts at all. Add a fallback check in the banking instructions display component: if `fundingSources.length === 0` and user has a Safe address, trigger starter account creation retroactively. This ensures existing users aren't left without deposit capabilities.
