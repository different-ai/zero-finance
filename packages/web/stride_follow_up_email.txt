Hi Casey,

No worries about missing the call - I know you're busy managing 100+ clients.

Quick follow-up question to help my research: I was investigating whether accounting firms spend more time getting clients to explain unclear transactions than doing actual bookkeeping work.

Since you handle bookkeeping for 100+ businesses across California, you'd know if this is actually a problem or not.

Two quick questions:
1. Does Stride handle transaction categorization/reconciliation for clients, or do you focus on other services?
2. If you do handle it, is getting clients to clarify transactions like "Wire Transfer 8472" or "ACH Payment - Unknown" a significant time drain for your team?

Just trying to figure out if I'm researching a real problem or imagining one that doesn't exist.

Either answer helps my research a lot.

Thanks,
Benjamin
