Hi Thomas,

Thanks for the personal follow-up! 

Actually, I'm not looking for accounting services right now - I'm a founder researching a specific operational challenge that accounting firms like Ignite Spot might face.

My question: When your team handles bookkeeping for clients and encounters unclear transactions (like "Wire Transfer 8472" or "ACH Payment - Unknown"), how much time do you spend getting clients to explain what these transactions actually are?

I'm testing whether this client back-and-forth is a real time drain for accounting firms, or if I'm imagining a problem that doesn't exist.

Since you're an accountant at Ignite Spot, you'd know better than anyone if this is actually painful or if firms have solved it efficiently.

Worth a quick 15-minute call to share your experience with this workflow?

Not selling anything - just research.

Thanks,
Benjamin
