# Stride Follow-Up Email - Mom Test Style

## Context

- Casey from Stride (100+ clients in California) missed the scheduled call
- Need to validate/invalidate hypothesis about transaction clarification time drain
- Using Mom Test principles to get factual answers

**Subject:** Quick follow-up - research question about bookkeeping workflows

Hi Casey,

No worries about missing the call - I know you're busy managing 100+ clients.

Quick follow-up question to help my research: I was investigating whether accounting firms spend more time getting clients to explain unclear transactions than doing actual bookkeeping work.

Since you handle bookkeeping for 100+ businesses across California, you'd know if this is actually a problem or not.

Two quick questions:

1. Does Stride handle transaction categorization/reconciliation for clients, or do you focus on other services?
2. If you do handle it, is getting clients to clarify transactions like "Wire Transfer 8472" or "ACH Payment - Unknown" a significant time drain for your team?

Just trying to figure out if I'm researching a real problem or imagining one that doesn't exist.

Either answer helps my research a lot.

Thanks,
Benjamin

## What This Accomplishes (Mom Test Principles)

✅ **Reminds them of the problem** - Transaction clarification time drain
✅ **Asks specific factual questions** - Do they handle this work? Is it painful?
✅ **Positions them as expert** - "you'd know if this is actually a problem"
✅ **Gives easy outs** - Maybe they don't even do this type of work
✅ **Makes it quick** - Two simple questions, not asking for a call
✅ **Admits you might be wrong** - "or imagining one that doesn't exist"

## Possible Outcomes

1. **"We don't do reconciliation"** = Wrong target segment
2. **"We do it but it's not painful"** = Hypothesis invalidated
3. **"We do it and it's a major pain"** = Hypothesis validated
4. **"We have solved it efficiently"** = Learn their solution
5. **No response** = They're not engaged enough to be a real customer anyway
