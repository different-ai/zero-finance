      <h1>Terms and Conditions (DeFi Protection Security Guarantee)</h1>
      <p>Last updated: July 26, 2024</p>

      <p>
        These Security Services Guarantee Terms & Conditions (this "Contract")
        applies to you only if you have purchased security services with the
        optional Security Services Guarantee contract through 0.finance. This
        Contract is for your sole benefit with no third party beneficiaries and
        is not assignable by you.
      </p>

      <h2>Security Services Guarantee</h2>
      <p>
        In the event of a Hack (defined below) due to an error in alerting the
        security of your account and your identified wallet(s) or smart
        contract(s) with deposits into an approved DeFi protocol ("Wallet(s)"),
        we agree to reimburse you up to the Maximum Reimbursement amount
        (defined below) for the loss or theft of your deposit from your Wallet,
        subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations set forth below (the
        "Security Services Guarantee").
      </p>

      <h3>Definition of Hack</h3>
      <p>
        For purposes of this Contract, "Hack" means any incident that exploits
        smart contract vulnerabilities in the DeFi protocol(s) ("Protocol")
        identified in your purchase confirmation ("Confirmation") that renders
        the DeFi Protocol's liabilities to you irredeemable (a "loss of funds",
        or a "Hack").
      </p>

      <h3>Covered Protocols and Blockchains</h3>
      <p>
        Protection is valid only for <strong>Morpho vaults</strong> accessed
        through this interface and on the Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base,
        BSC, Fantom, Gnosis, Mantle, Optimism, and Polygon blockchains
        ("Blockchain").
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Insurance and Security:</strong> Insurance coverage is provided
        by Chainproof. Smart contract security audits are performed by
        Quantstamp.
      </p>

      <h3>Reimbursement Amount</h3>
      <p>
        Under our Security Services Guarantee, we will reimburse you for the
        lesser of (i) the amount of funds lost in the Hack, including any
        accrued interest or yield, less any liabilities that you owe to the DeFi
        protocol or other users of the DeFi protocol, or (ii) your chosen
        Maximum Reimbursement amount (each in USD) ("Damages"). In no event will
        our liability for Damages exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate across any
        one Protocol.
      </p>

      <h3>Valuation Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        The valuation of the funds (or tokens in general, including NFTs) lost
        at the time of the Hack will be calculated in USD terms based on data
        from multiple sources:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For fungible tokens: median of the last 30-day average UTC closing USD
          price based on data from CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and OnChainFX
        </li>
        <li>
          For non-fungible tokens: median of the 30-day average UTC closing
          collection floor price based on data from CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko,
          and DeepNFTValue
        </li>
        <li>
          For all other tokens: valuation conducted at our sole discretion
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Purchase Limits</h3>
      <p>
        You may only purchase a Security Services Guarantee through one Wallet
        per Protocol; however, you may increase your Wallet's Maximum
        Reimbursement amount at any time, up to a maximum of $1,000,000. Any
        violation of these terms may result in the immediate cancellation of any
        or all of your Contracts, and any of our obligations of reimbursement
        will be void.
      </p>

      <h3>Processing Fee</h3>
      <p>
        A case review and processing fee of 5% of your chosen Maximum
        Reimbursement amount ("Processing Fee") will automatically be withheld
        from your payment. Should the Processing Fee exceed the Damages, no case
        will be processed and no payment will be made.
      </p>

      <h2>Qualification</h2>
      <p>To qualify for the Security Guarantee, you must have:</p>

      <h3>Secondary Coverage</h3>
      <p>
        Our liability under this Contract is secondary to any insurance coverage
        or other asset protection that you may carry, and the Maximum Damages
        may be reduced by any amounts you recover or are owed or receive under
        any applicable coverage or protection. You agree to notify us promptly
        of any such applicable coverage or protection in the event of a Hack.
      </p>

      <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        In no event will we be liable to you (or any third party) for any
        consequential, special, indirect, incidental, punitive, or exemplary
        damages, nor for any loss of profits, revenue, use or corruption of
        software or data, costs of substitute goods or services, interruption,
        delay, or outages arising out of or relating to a Hack or this Contract.
      </p>

      <h3>Root Cause Liability</h3>
      <p>
        Our liability under this contract is limited to the DeFi protocol that
        is identified as the root cause of the loss of funds. If a Hack affects
        multiple protocols in a dependency chain, reimbursement is determined
        based on which specific protocol's vulnerability was exploited.
      </p>

      <h2>Payment & Fees</h2>
      <p>
        Our Security Guarantee fee is nonrefundable. If you fail to make any
        payment when due for any reason, we may immediately suspend or terminate
        your Security Guarantee contract and we reserve the right, in our sole
        discretion, to deny any reimbursement incurred or due when your account
        is suspended or terminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Purchase of our Security Guarantee is not mandatory for your use of our
        services; by declining our Security Guarantee, you assume all deposit
        risk and agree to not hold us liable for any lost, stolen, or damaged
        deposits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payment of any fees under this Contract must be made in full when due.
        You are responsible for notifying us of any changes in your billing
        account information. If you fail to make any payment when due, we may
        immediately and without notice suspend or terminate your Security
        Guarantee and deny any Damages incurred or due when your account is
        suspended or terminated.
      </p>

      <h2>Term & Termination</h2>

        The term of your Contract begins on the date of purchase and lasts until
        the date identified in your Confirmation. You may terminate your
        Contract by either: (i) providing us with written notice of termination
        prior to the start of your next term; or (ii) terminating your security
        monitoring services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may immediately, and without notice, terminate your Contract in its
        entirety, or terminate its applicability to any specific deposit, for
        your violation of this Contract, including for your failure to make any
        payment when due. We may terminate any Contract for convenience by
        providing you with seven (7) days written notice prior to the start of
        your next term.
      </p>
