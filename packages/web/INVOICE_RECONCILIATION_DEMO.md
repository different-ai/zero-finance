# Invoice Reconciliation Demo

## What We've Built

We've created a new invoice reconciliation page at `/dashboard/inbox-v2` that transforms the existing inbox feature into a QuickBooks-integrated invoice management system.

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Invoice Management Interface**
   - Table view with invoice details (date, invoice #, vendor, amount, GL account, class, status)
   - Bulk selection and actions for multiple invoices
   - Search and filter capabilities by vendor, status, and date

2. **QuickBooks Integration (CSV-based)**
   - Hardcoded Chart of Accounts dropdown with common GL codes
   - QuickBooks Classes for departmental categorization
   - Export to QuickBooks-ready CSV format
   - Import CSV from QuickBooks (simulated)

3. **Bulk Coding Workflow**
   - Select multiple invoices
   - Apply GL account and class in bulk
   - Add notes for audit trail
   - Bulk approve/reject actions

4. **Statistics Dashboard**
   - Total invoices pending coding
   - Amount totals
   - Today's processed count
   - Real-time status indicators

### File Structure

- **Main Page**: `/packages/web/src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/inbox-v2/page.tsx`
- **Navigation**: Added to sidebar at `/packages/web/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`
- **Existing Services Used**:
  - AI document processing: `/packages/web/src/server/services/ai-service.ts`
  - CSV utilities: `/packages/web/src/lib/utils/csv.ts`
  - Inbox store and utilities

### How It Works

1. **Data Flow**:
   - Invoices are pulled from existing inbox cards
   - Each card is transformed to include invoice-specific fields
   - GL codes and classes are stored in metadata

2. **CSV Export**:
   - Filters only coded invoices
   - Formats data for QuickBooks import
   - Includes: Date, Invoice #, Vendor, Amount, GL Account, Class, Notes

3. **Mock QuickBooks Connection**:
   - Shows "QuickBooks Connected" badge
   - Dropdown populated with standard Chart of Accounts
   - Ready for OAuth integration when needed

### Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **QuickBooks OAuth Setup** (3-4 weeks):
   - Implement OAuth flow
   - Store tokens securely
   - API client for QuickBooks

2. **Real-time Sync**:
   - Push coded invoices to QuickBooks
   - Pull Chart of Accounts dynamically
   - Two-way sync for payment status

3. **Enhanced AI Processing**:
   - Auto-suggest GL codes based on vendor/description
   - Learn from historical coding patterns
   - Confidence scoring for auto-approval

### Demo Instructions

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/inbox-v2` in your application
2. You'll see the invoice reconciliation interface
3. Select invoices using checkboxes
4. Click "Code Selected" to apply GL accounts and classes
5. Export coded invoices using "Export to QB" button
6. The CSV can be imported directly into QuickBooks

### Technical Notes

- Uses existing tRPC endpoints for data fetching
- Leverages existing Zustand store for state management
- Fully responsive with Tailwind CSS
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Integrates with existing authentication and permissions

This demo proves the concept with minimal changes to the existing codebase while providing immediate value through CSV import/export functionality.
