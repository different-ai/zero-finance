## üìã Demo Script

### Opening

"Hi, I'm Ben. I lost $40k as a solo founder to bad financial admin. Now I'm applying lessons from designing unique user interfaces to finance.

This is my financial inbox. Each line you see is surfaced using custom configuration to help me stay on top of my financial admin. It's connected to my emails and makes sure only signal remains once it hits 0 finance."

   - Click on "Sightglass Weekend Personal" rule
   - "I've set up this rule because I often use my company card by mistake on weekends"

2. **Return to Inbox (Pending tab)**

### Part 3: Live Processing Demo

#### Demo 1: Personal Expense Classification

1. **Click on the Sightglass Coffee receipt**
   - "This is a receipt from Sunday afternoon. Unfortunately, I used my company card by mistake."

2. **Open the document drop zone**
   - "Let me show you how our AI processes this"
   - Drag the Sightglass email screenshot into the drop zone

3. **Watch the processing**
   - AI will identify it as a personal expense
   - Check the Card Actions tab to see the classification

#### Demo 2: Auto-Payment Scheduling

1. **Click on the Acme Corp Invoice**
   - "This is a vendor invoice that needs payment"

2. **Process it through the drop zone**
   - AI will schedule payment for 2 business days
   - "Notice we don't execute immediately - you have 2 days to review"

3. **Show the scheduled payment in action log**

#### Demo 3: Spam Filtering

1. **Click on the Marketing Newsletter**
   - "This is just marketing spam"

2. **Process it**
   - AI will auto-dismiss it
   - "It's automatically filtered out so I can focus on what matters"

### Part 4: The Magic

"Here's where the magic happens. 0 finance is not just a financial admin dashboard - it's a bank account at its core. This means we can go beyond bookkeeping.

When that invoice gets processed, we don't just categorize it - we actually execute the payment. But with built-in safeguards like the 2-day review period.

Traditional financial interfaces show you transactions or basic analytics. We show you decisions that have already been made and just require your last approval.

Over time, we improve our decisions significantly by having you intervene in bad decisions and ignore good decisions, leading to an ever-improving decision-making process.

This is the future of financial interfaces - invisible, intelligent, and always learning."
