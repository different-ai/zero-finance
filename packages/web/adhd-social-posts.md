## Post 1: The Origin Story
```
hey there

i've been struggling with adhd all my life and created many products in the past to help thousands of people lead less stressful lives. 

now i'm building a bank to make sure no one loses money just because they didn't pay their bills on time.

this bank makes it easy for you to:
- get reminded until you actually do the thing
- pay bills with literally one tap
- never hunt for receipts again

because losing $50 to a late fee when you have adhd isn't about being irresponsible. it's about time blindness being real.

who else is tired of the adhd tax?
```

## Post 2: The Receipt Hunt
```
hey there

last week i spent 3 hours looking for receipts for my accountant. 

3. hours.

they were in:
- gmail (searched "receipt" - 847 results)
- my photos (somewhere between dog pics)
- downloads folder (good luck)
- that drawer (you know the one)

so i built something that finds them all automatically. because with adhd, "i'll file this later" means "this is gone forever"

anyone else have a receipt graveyard?
```

## Post 3: The Late Fee Confession
```
hey there

confession: i once paid $180 in late fees in a single month

not because i didn't have money. because i literally forgot the same bill existed. three times.

with adhd, "out of sight, out of mind" is painfully literal

so i'm building a bank that won't let you forget. it'll remind you gently, then firmly, then VERY firmly. with colors and sounds and "hey seriously do this NOW" energy.

what's the most expensive thing adhd has cost you?
```

## Post 4: The Dopamine Hit
```
hey there

you know what sucks about managing money with adhd? zero dopamine.

pay a bill? nothing.
categorize expenses? silence.
file taxes on time? crickets.

so i added celebrations to my bank. every small win gets confetti. because adhd brains need that hit.

finished a 30-second task? üéâ CELEBRATION
paid before the deadline? üéØ STREAK BONUS
found all your receipts? üèÜ ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED

what boring adult task do you wish had achievements?
```

## Post 5: The Time Blindness
```
hey there

"your payment is due in 30 days" means nothing to my adhd brain

you know what works?
- "due in 4 weeks"
- "due when your netflix renews"  
- "due the day after your therapy appointment"
- "PAY THIS NOW OR BAD THINGS HAPPEN"

so i built a bank that speaks adhd. it knows time blindness is real and plans around it.

how do you trick your brain into understanding deadlines?
```

## Post 6: The Quick Win
```
hey there

my adhd hack: if it takes less than 90 seconds, it gets a ‚ö° lightning bolt

i built this into my bank:
‚ö° approve invoice (30 sec)
‚ö° categorize expense (45 sec)
‚ö° pay that bill (60 sec)

5 lightning bolts = 1 actually productive morning

the best part? it pre-fills everything. zero decisions needed.

what's your "quick win" threshold?
```

## Post 7: The Executive Dysfunction
```
hey there

executive dysfunction is explaining to your therapist that you have $5k in the bank but haven't paid your $50 phone bill in 3 months

it's not about the money. it's about the 17 micro-decisions between "i should pay this" and actually paying it.

so i removed the decisions:
- auto-find the bill ‚úì
- auto-fill the amount ‚úì
- one button to pay ‚úì
- instant confirmation ‚úì

what task has been on your list the longest?
```

## Post 8: The Community
```
hey there

fun fact: when i posted about building an adhd-friendly bank, 500+ people dm'd me their financial horror stories

we're all out here:
- paying the adhd tax
- drowning in receipts
- forgetting bills exist
- feeling shame about it

you're not bad with money. your brain just works different.

if you want early access, comment "‚ö°" below. let's fix this together.
```

## Post 9: The Money Anxiety
```
hey there

adhd money anxiety is checking your bank balance 47 times a day but never actually looking at the number

it's knowing you probably forgot something expensive

my bank shows you:
- what needs attention (in red)
- what's handled (in green)  
- what's coming up (with timers)
- what you can actually spend

no more anxiety scrolling. just answers.

what's your worst money anxiety?
```

## Post 10: The Success Story
```
hey there

just got this message from a beta user:

"first month using your app:
- zero late fees (usually $100+)
- found $400 in receipts i forgot
- actually filed quarterly taxes on time
- got a dopamine hit from paying bills???"

this is why i'm building this. because adhd tax is real and it's expensive.

we're going live next month. who wants in?
```
