# Qualifying Fractional CFOs with 50+ Clients

## Your Target: High-Volume Fractional CFO Firms

**Hypothesis**: Fractional CFOs managing 50+ clients have exponentially worse context and communication problems, making them ideal customers for AI-mediated reconciliation.

## Early Qualification Questions (First 2 Minutes)

### Opening Question

"Before we dive in, can you give me a quick sense of your practice - roughly how many clients are you managing right now?"

### Follow-up Based on Answer:

**If 50+ clients:**

- "Wow, that's significant scale - is that you alone or do you have a team?"
- "At that volume, I imagine reconciliation is a massive operation - how do you handle it?"

**If less than 50:**

- "Got it - and is scaling up the number of clients a goal, or are you happy at this size?"
- "What would need to be true for you to take on significantly more clients?"

## Confirming They're the Right Segment (50+ Clients)

### The Volume Reality Check

"With 50+ clients, walk me through what month-end looks like - do they all close at once?"

**Listen for:**

- Chaos/overwhelming descriptions = GOOD
- "We have it under control" = DIG DEEPER (might have already solved it)
- "We don't do reconciliation for all of them" = WRONG SEGMENT

### The Team Structure Question

"At 50+ clients, I assume you have staff - who actually does the reconciliation?"

**Good answers:**

- "I have VAs but I still have to review everything"
- "My team does it but they constantly need client clarification"
- "It's a mix - some clients we do, others we just review"

**Bad answers:**

- "Each client has a dedicated bookkeeper" (too sophisticated)
- "We outsource all reconciliation" (not your customer)
- "Clients do their own books" (different service model)

### The Pain Scale Question

"On a scale of 1-10, how painful is gathering context from 50+ clients for reconciliation?"

**Follow-up:**

- If 8-10: "Tell me about the worst one last month"
- If 5-7: "What makes it manageable?" (learn their workaround)
- If 1-4: They're not your customer

## Quantifying the 50+ Client Problem

### The Time Audit

"Across all 50+ clients, how many hours per month does your team spend just on back-and-forth communication about transactions?"

**Dig deeper:**

- "How many emails/messages is that?"
- "What's the average response time from clients?"
- "How many transactions need clarification per client?"

### The Bottleneck Finder

"With 50+ clients, what's the single biggest bottleneck in your reconciliation process?"

**Good signals:**

- "Getting clients to respond to questions"
- "Context switching between different clients"
- "Training staff on each client's specifics"
- "Keeping track of who we're waiting on"

**Bad signals:**

- "Finding good bookkeepers" (hiring problem)
- "The software is too complex" (training problem)
- "Clients won't give us access" (trust problem)

### The Economics Question

"At 50+ clients, what's your average reconciliation fee per client, and what margin are you making?"

**Follow-up:**

- "How much could you increase margins if reconciliation was instant?"
- "How many more clients could you take on with the same team?"
- "Have you ever fired a client because reconciliation was unprofitable?"

---

## Testing Their Current Solution (Critical for 50+ Client Firms)

### The System Question

"Managing 50+ clients, you must have some systems - what's your current tech stack for reconciliation?"

**Look for:**

- Multiple tools duct-taped together = GOOD
- One enterprise solution = Might be locked in
- "Email and spreadsheets" = PERFECT (high pain, low sophistication)

### The Workaround Investigation

"With that many clients, I'm sure you've tried to optimize this - what have you already tried?"

**Great answers:**

- "We built internal tools but they break"
- "We tried VAs but training takes forever"
- "We have SOPs but clients don't follow them"

### The Breaking Point Question

"At what point does your current system break? 75 clients? 100?"

This reveals if they're planning to scale further and how urgent the problem is.

---

## The 50+ Client Commitment Test

### The Pilot Structure

"For firms with 50+ clients, we're looking for 3 pilot partners. You'd pick your 10 most annoying clients for reconciliation and we'd handle the context-gathering for one month. What would make that worth trying?"

### The ROI Question

"Quick math - if this saved 2 hours per client per month across 50 clients, that's 100 hours. What's that worth to your firm?"

### The Integration Reality Check

"With 50+ clients, you probably have different banks, accounting software, etc. Walk me through the variety you're dealing with."

---

## Disqualification Signals (Even with 50+ Clients)

### They're NOT your customer if:

1. **They've already solved it:** "We have a full reconciliation team and proprietary software"
2. **Different business model:** "We only do CFO strategy, bookkeeping is handled elsewhere"
3. **Too enterprise:** "We have an offshore team of 20 handling this"
4. **Not growing:** "We're actually trying to reduce clients and go upstream"
5. **Price insensitive:** "Cost doesn't matter, we just pass it through to clients"

---

## The Perfect 50+ Client Customer

You're looking for:

- **50-150 clients** (big enough for pain, small enough to be nimble)
- **Small team** (under 10 people)
- **Mix of client types** (complexity creates context problems)
- **Growth mindset** (want to get to 200+ clients)
- **Already paying** for multiple tools ($2-5K/month in software)
- **Actively looking** for solutions (not resigned to the pain)

---

## The Closing Question for 50+ Client Firms

"Based on what you've told me about managing 50+ clients, if I could cut your reconciliation time by 60% without adding headcount, what would that enable you to do differently?"

**Great answers:**

- "Take on 30 more clients with the same team"
- "Finally focus on advisory instead of cleanup"
- "Stop working weekends during month-end"
- "Fire our most annoying clients"

**Bad answers:**

- "I'd have to think about it"
- "Not sure it would change much"
- "We'd probably just do more thorough reviews"
