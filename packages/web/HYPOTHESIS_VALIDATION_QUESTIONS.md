# Hypothesis Validation Questions for Fractional CFO Reconciliation

## Our Hypothesis

**Problem:** Most of the reconciliation automation is already solved by classical software, but fractional CFOs still spend too much time doing reconciliation because they lose time due to lack of context and slow communication channels.

**Solution:** By creating software that mediates communication between fractional CFOs and their clients with AI agents, we can reduce the time spent gathering required context to automate reconciliation.

## Interview Questions Following The Mom Test

### 1. Understanding Current Workflow (Past Specific Examples)

- "Walk me through the last time you had to reconcile a client's books - start from when you received the bank statements."
- "Can you show me the actual emails/messages from your last reconciliation with [specific client]? How many back-and-forths were there?"
- "Tell me about the most frustrating reconciliation you did this month - what made it so painful?"
- "What happened the last time a client was slow to respond to your reconciliation questions?"

### 2. Quantifying the Context Problem

- "In your last reconciliation, how much time did you spend just trying to understand what transactions were for?"
- "Show me a transaction from last week where you had to ask the client for clarification - how long did that take to resolve?"
- "What percentage of transactions can you categorize immediately vs needing client input?"
- "Looking at yesterday's work - how many transactions did you process and how many required follow-up?"

### 3. Testing the Communication Channel Assumption

- "When you need clarification on a transaction, what exactly do you do? Walk me through your actual process."
- "How long does it typically take to get a response from clients when you ask about specific transactions?"
- "What happens when a client doesn't respond to your questions quickly?"
- "Show me the last email thread where you asked a client about transactions - how did that go?"

### 4. Validating the Solution Direction

- "Have you tried any tools to speed up client communication? What happened?"
- "If you could never solve the context problem, what would you do differently?"
- "How much would faster client responses actually save you in a typical reconciliation?"
- "What have you already tried to make reconciliation faster?"

### 5. Finding the Real Constraints

- "Why haven't you hired someone to handle the back-and-forth with clients?"
- "What prevents you from refusing clients who are slow to respond?"
- "How do you currently price reconciliation work - fixed fee or hourly?"
- "Have you ever dropped a client because reconciliation was too painful?"

### 6. Understanding the Business Impact

- "How much revenue do you lose by spending time on reconciliation vs higher-value CFO work?"
- "Have you ever lost a client because reconciliation took too long?"
- "What's your hourly rate for CFO work vs what you charge for reconciliation?"
- "How many more clients could you take on if reconciliation was instant?"

### 7. High-Signal Implementation Questions

- "Some fractional CFOs use AI to help with categorization - have you tried that?"
- "If I could show you the last 10 transactions from your client right now, how many could you categorize without asking them?"
- "What would need to be true for you to pay $X/month for better reconciliation tools?"
- "Walk me through your current tech stack for reconciliation - what do you use?"

## Red Flags to Watch For

These responses suggest your hypothesis might be wrong:

- **"Context isn't really the issue, it's more about..."** → Dig into what they say next
- **"I already have a system that works pretty well"** → Understand their workaround in detail
- **"My clients are actually pretty responsive"** → Maybe it's not all fractional CFOs
- **"The real time sink is actually..."** → Listen for different problems
- **"I don't really do much reconciliation"** → Wrong customer segment
- **"We've already automated most of that"** → Their problem might be solved

## Follow-Up Dig Questions

When you hear something interesting, dig deeper:

- "Tell me more about that."
- "That seems to really bug you — I bet there's a story here."
- "What makes it so awful?"
- "Why haven't you been able to fix this already?"
- "Can you walk me through the last time that happened?"
- "What else have you tried?"

## The Money Questions

Save these for when they've already admitted the problem exists:

- "How much would it be worth to cut reconciliation time in half?"
- "What would you pay to never chase clients for transaction details again?"
- "If this problem got worse, what would happen to your business?"
- "How much did you spend last year trying to solve this?"

## Rules for the Conversation

1. **Never mention your solution** until you understand their problem deeply
2. **Always ask about specific past events**, not hypothetical futures
3. **When they give generic answers**, anchor to specific examples
4. **If they offer feature ideas**, understand WHY they want them
5. **Watch for emotional reactions** - frustration and anger are golden signals
6. **If they seem unengaged**, this might not be a real problem for them

## Post-Interview Actions

After each interview:

1. Review notes with your team immediately
2. Update your hypothesis based on what you learned
3. Identify the top 3 things that surprised you
4. Decide: Are we solving the right problem for the right person?
5. Plan what different questions to ask next time
