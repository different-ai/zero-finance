# Zero Finance Demo Script - Ben's Version

_Total demo time: 2-3 minutes_

---

## Opening

**⏱ 10 seconds**
**Dashboard shows: Empty state**

> "Hey I'm Ben and this is Zero Finance - an 8% Savings Account for Your Startup."

> "Nowadays typical seed stage startups have $2-3 million sitting in a traditional bank earning essentially nothing - 0.1% APY. That's a massive opportunity cost."

---

## Step 1: Empty Dashboard

**⏱ 15 seconds**
**Dashboard shows: Zero balance, clean interface**

> "What you're seeing here is the Zero Finance dashboard. Right now it's empty. But let me show you how you can start earning today."

> "After signing up and filling out some information about your company, you'll be able to send a simple deposit to your account."

---

## Step 2: Funding Your Account

**⏱ 20 seconds**
**Dashboard shows: Deposit interface with wire instructions**

> "Funding works like any bank transfer. You wire money from Chase, Mercury, or wherever you bank today."

> "The deposit screen shows standard wire instructions - routing number, account number. Exactly what you're used to."

> "Funds typically arrive same day for wires, 1-2 days for ACH."

---

## Step 3: Funds Received

**⏱ 15 seconds**
**Dashboard shows: Balance updates to $2,500,000**

> "Your funds just arrived. They're now in your account."

> "You can spend them via normal ACH transfers to pay for bills or invoices."

---

## Step 4: Savings Page

**⏱ 30 seconds**
**Auto-navigates to /dashboard/savings**
**Shows: $2.5M earning in 8% APY vault with live counter**

> "Now let's see how you're benefiting already from these funds."

> "Using the current balance, you're already making $547 per day."

> "That's close to $17k monthly and $200k annually."

> "This happened without any configuration needed. The moment your money arrives, it starts earning 8% APY automatically."

---

## Step 5: Value Proposition

**⏱ 20 seconds**
**Stay on savings page showing yield metrics**

> "That is Zero Finance."

> "Everything is transparent - you can see exactly what you're earning and when."

> "For a startup with a $200k monthly burn rate, this yield alone extends runway by 12 full months. That's an extra year without dilution."

---

## Closing

**⏱ 20 seconds**
**Dashboard shows: Current features highlight**

> "That's Zero Finance - it gives you 8% APY on idle cash with complete liquidity."

> "The underlying yield sources are insured, making sure you're not messing around with investors' money."

> "Next up we'll launch corporate cards that spend directly from your yield-earning balance."

> "The goal is simple - help startups extend runway without raising more capital."

> "Thanks for listening."
