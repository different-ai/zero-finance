## Post 1: The Origin Story
```
hey there

after 10 years of helping founders build companies, i noticed something: we're amazing at building products but terrible at managing the money they make.

i've watched brilliant founders:
- pay $1000s in late fees
- miss tax deadlines (hello penalties)
- leave money in checking earning 0%

so i'm building a bank that runs your finances on autopilot. because you should focus on your business, not bookkeeping.

who else is tired of being their own CFO?

## Post 2: The Invoice Chase
```
hey there

tracking down invoice payments shouldn't be a full-time job

last month:
- sent 12 invoices
- 8 payment reminder emails
- 4 "checking in" messages
- 2 awkward phone calls
- 1 client who ghosted completely

time spent: 6 hours
time i wanted to spend: 0

building a bank that chases payments so you don't have to. automatic reminders, escalations, and a dashboard that shows who owes what.

what's your worst late payment story?
```

## Post 3: The Tax Panic
```
hey there

april 14th, 11:47pm

me: frantically downloading bank statements
also me: "wait, what counts as a business expense?"
still me: "how much did i make again?"

every. single. year.

so i built a bank that automatically sets aside taxes as you earn. tracks deductions. sends quarterly reminders. no more april panic.

when did you last think about quarterly taxes? (be honest)
```

## Post 4: The Cash Flow Blindness
```
hey there

running out of money with $50k in outstanding invoices hits different

cash flow killed my first business. not lack of customers. not bad product. just... math.

now i'm building a bank that shows:
- when money actually arrives
- what you can actually spend
- how long your runway is
- which clients always pay late

because "profitable on paper" doesn't pay rent

what's your cash flow horror story?
```

## Post 5: The Expense Chaos
```
hey there

my business expenses last month:
- stripe: $2,847
- aws: $423
- random saas tools: $1,892
- that subscription i forgot about: $79
- another forgotten one: $49
- wait, what's this $299 charge?

total time categorizing for taxes: 4 hours
total joy experienced: 0

building a bank that categorizes automatically. knows stripe = payment processing. aws = infrastructure. no more spreadsheet hell.

how many subscriptions are you accidentally paying for?
```

## Post 6: The Multiple Account Nightmare
```
hey there

current banking setup:
- business checking (bank 1)
- tax savings (bank 2)
- personal checking (bank 3)
- high-yield savings (bank 4)

daily routine:
- log into 4 apps
- mentally calculate transfers
- move money around
- forget which account has what
- pay from wrong account
- panic

building one bank with smart "vaults" instead. automatic allocation. one login. zero confusion.

how many banking apps do you have?
```

## Post 7: The Productivity Cost
```
hey there

last week's "quick" financial tasks:
- "quick" expense report: 2 hours
- "quick" invoice creation: 45 mins
- "quick" bank reconciliation: 1.5 hours
- "quick" tax prep: gave up

total: 4+ hours of not building my business

building a bank that does this in the background. ai categorization. automatic invoicing. real-time reconciliation. 

imagine having those 4 hours back every week.

what would you build with an extra 200 hours/year?
```

## Post 8: The Freelancer to Founder
```
hey there

year 1: "i'm a freelancer!"
year 2: "wait, i need an LLC?"
year 3: "what's a quarterly tax?"
year 4: "i should probably hire an accountant"
year 5: "why is finance so hard?"

every founder's journey includes accidentally becoming a CFO

building a bank that grows with you. from first invoice to first hire. handles the complexity so you can focus on what you're actually good at.

what's the most painful part of your finance stack?
```

## Post 9: The Wake-Up Call
```
hey there

the moment i knew i needed to build this:

friend (successful founder, $2M ARR): "just realized i haven't invoiced anyone in 3 months"

me: "...what"

him: "yeah, probably $200k sitting out there"

me: "..."

him: "anyway, what's new with you?"

if he's struggling, we all are.

comment "ğŸ“Š" if you've ever forgotten to invoice someone
```

## Post 10: The Success Story
```
hey there

beta user just sent this:

"first month results:
- collected $12k in overdue invoices (automatically)
- saved $3k for taxes (didn't even notice)
- found $800 in missed deductions
- spent 0 minutes on bookkeeping

best part: i forgot the app existed"

that last line? that's the goal. banking that just works.

200 spots left in beta. who wants their finances on autopilot?
```

## Post 11: The Receipt Reality
```
hey there

types of founders:
1. saves every receipt in pristine folders
2. has a shoebox somewhere
3. "receipts are in my email... somewhere"
4. "wait, i need receipts?"

(i'm a recovering #4)

building a bank that finds receipts automatically. email, photos, downloads. ai extracts the data. you get the deduction.

which type are you? (no judgment)
```

## Post 12: The Client Management
```
hey there

clients, ranked by payment speed:
1. unicorn client (pays early)
2. normal human (pays on time)
3. "check's in the mail" (+ 30 days)
4. "didn't receive invoice" (you sent 5)
5. ghost (rip)

building a bank that tracks payment patterns. knows who pays late. adjusts reminders accordingly. maybe even suggests firing bad clients.

what % of your time is spent on #3-5?
```
