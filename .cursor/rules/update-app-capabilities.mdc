# rule – keep `app-capabilities-summary.mdc` fresh

Whenever you add, remove, or change a user-facing capability in the Zero Finance web app, **update** the summary file:

```
.cursor/rules/app-capabilities-summary.mdc
```

Update steps for AI agents:
1. Re-run a quick code/route scan or rely on domain knowledge to identify the change.
2. Open the summary file and patch only the affected bullet(s).
3. Commit the change with a concise message, e.g. `docs: update capabilities summary – add card-to-card transfers`.

⚠️  Do NOT let the summary drift – other agents read it first before searching the codebase.
