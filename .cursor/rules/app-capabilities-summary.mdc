# zero-finance app capabilities – 2025-06-24

## navigation surface (what users actually see)

1. **Sidebar items** – Overview  /  Invoices  /  Settings  (only these three are permanent)
2. **Secondary links**  
   • Inbox (via Settings ▸ Integrations ▸ "Go to Inbox")  
   • Earn dashboard (banner link to `/dashboard/earn`)  
   • Send-USDC quick action (card on Overview)  
   • Tools / admin pages are **hidden** from normal users.

## wallet & accounts

* each user gets a **gnosis safe** (smart-account) on Base; transactions are executed via the user's Privy smart-account.
* privy EOA is abstracted away; the safe address is what the UI shows.

## money in (on-/off-ramp)

* **align integration (live api)**
  * user completes KYC ⇒ align creates customer id
  * after approval the app auto-creates **two virtual accounts**:
    * USD / ACH
    * EUR / IBAN
  * deposits to those coords arrive in align, auto-swap to USDC, forwarded to the user's safe.
* "Account details" dialog on Overview shows the ACH/IBAN data.

## money out

* **simplified off-ramp** modal (Move → SimplifiedOffRamp component)
  * creates align `offrampTransfer`, then signs & relays ERC-20 transfer from safe.
* **Send USDC** page – raw ERC-20 transfer form (also relay-based).

## yield / earn

* hidden `/dashboard/earn` uses Fluidkey ERC-4626 vault.
* user can deposit & withdraw assets or shares via safe relay.

## invoices & inbox

* manual invoice creator (`/dashboard/create-invoice`)  → Request Network invoice for crypto.
* **Gmail inbox** (`/dashboard/inbox`) – comprehensive email processing & automation:

    * Sync emails with date range filters (7d, 14d, 30d, all time)
    * Background sync jobs with pagination support
    * Resume failed/incomplete sync jobs
    * Real-time sync status tracking
  * **AI-Powered Processing**:
    * Converts emails → structured InboxCards
    * Extracts invoice details from email content
    * Generates invoices from plain text
    * AI chat assistant for card interactions
  * **UI Features**:
    * Three tabs: Pending / History / Action Logs
    * Real-time activity stats (pending count, today's executed, 7-day sparkline)
    * Search, filtering, and grouping options (by vendor/amount/frequency)
    * Multi-select action bar for bulk operations
    * AI insights banner
  * **Request Network Integration**:

  * slide 2: gmail integration & ai-powered inbox
  * slide 3: financial command center overview
  * auto-advances, skippable, replayable from help menu
