# Zero Finance Pitch Feedback - Raghav

## Meeting Details

- **Date:** September 12
- **Topic:** Startup Savings Account Pitch Review for Zero Finance

## Original Pitch Script

> Hi. I'm Raghav. Cofounder of Zero Finance, and we are building an insured savings accounts for startups. Startups with $5M in the bank are missing out on over $200,000 a year. Their $5M earns 4% yearly, barely beating inflation. While DeFi yields hover between 8-12%. This becomes budget and allows startups to add headcount. But startups don't even consider DeFi as a valid option because it feels risky like a casino. So we are removing the risk. 8% APY, double what banks offer, and insured for minimal risk exposure to founders. You buy money in, automatically start earning yield, and instantly withdraw any time. Works just like any savings account, but one that starts paying salaries. And it's working. In just over two weeks, we have gathered over a million dollars of AUM ready to be deployed on the platform once we go live. Our founding team built Gnosis Pay, the first stablecoin backed debit card, and scaled it to over $75,000,000 in yearly volume. You've solved both the technical and regulatory challenges. You have done it for crypto consumers before. Now we wanna do it for every startup. Thank you.

## Feedback Received

### 1. Remove "Casino" Reference

**Feedback:** "Feels like a casino isn't necessary... just feeling too risky, not a casino. Like, no one wants to gamble with this money anyway."

**Suggested Alternatives:**

- "It feels too risky"
- "Startups perceive it as too risky"
- "The risk feels unmanageable to founders"
- "Startups don't understand the risks or feel they're too high"
- "DeFi appears too risky for startup treasuries"

### 2. Emphasize "Starts Paying Salaries"

**Feedback:** "When you say 'starts paying salaries,' that really landed. I think you should actually have it be bolded on this page."

**Suggested Emphasis:**

- Make this the central value proposition
- Repeat it multiple times in the pitch
- Bold it on the slide
- Consider variations: "A savings account that starts paying salaries"

### 3. Replace "LOI" with "Waitlist"

**Feedback:** "You don't need to say LOI. Waitlist is actually stronger... Please do not use LOIs, it's becoming a vanity metric."

**Suggested Changes:**

- "$1M AUM on our waitlist"
- "$1M committed on our waitlist"
- "$1M ready to deploy from our waitlist"
- "Waitlist with $1M in committed funds"

### 4. Add Title to Chart

**Feedback:** "Your chart on the right needs some kind of title or something. Otherwise, it looks like clip art."

**Suggested Titles:**

- "Yield Comparison: Banks vs Zero Finance"
- "8% APY vs 4% Bank Returns"
- "Double Your Startup's Returns"
- "Zero Finance Advantage"

### 5. Add Company Logos

**Feedback:** "I'd add some logos where it worked with the pay or the startups that are waiting."

**Implementation:**

- Display logos of waitlist companies
- Show logos of committed startups
- Include client company logos
- Feature logos of early adopters

### 6. Add "Why Now" Opening

**Feedback:** "I wanna see why now type of beginning... stablecoin adoption... companies reaching IRR way faster"

**Suggested Opening:**

- Start with market timing
- Mention stablecoin/crypto adoption by web2 companies
- Highlight AI startups reaching profitability faster
- Note higher revenue per employee trends
- Connect to cash management opportunities

### 7. Correct Company Name

**Feedback:** "Please add zero. We just I can even do it for you right now."

**Change:** Always use "Zero Finance" not just "Finance"

### 8. Three Bullet Points for Product Features

**Feedback:** "When you talk about derisking, say it in three bullet points... 8% APY, are insured against losses, and withdrawn instantly."

**Suggested Format:**

- 8% APY guaranteed returns
- Fully insured against losses
- Instant withdrawals anytime

## Improved Pitch Script

Hi. I'm Raghav, cofounder of **Zero Finance**, and we are building insured savings accounts for startups.

**Why now?** Stablecoin adoption has gone mainstream - even web2 companies want crypto benefits. Plus, AI startups are reaching profitability faster with smaller teams, creating more cash reserves but no CFO to manage them.

Startups with $5M in the bank are missing out on over $200,000 a year. Their $5M earns 4% yearly, barely beating inflation, while DeFi yields hover between 8-12%. This extra yield **starts paying salaries** - literally funding additional headcount.

But startups don't even consider DeFi as a valid option because **it feels too risky**.

So we're removing that risk entirely. Our solution offers:

- **8% APY** - double what banks offer
- **Fully insured** against losses
- **Instant withdrawals** anytime

You put money in, automatically start earning yield, and instantly withdraw whenever needed. Works just like any savings account, but this one **starts paying salaries**.

And it's working. In just two weeks, we have over **$1 million on our waitlist** ready to be deployed once we go live.

Our founding team built Gnosis Pay, the first stablecoin-backed debit card, and scaled it to over $75 million in yearly volume. We've solved both the technical and regulatory challenges. We've done it for crypto consumers before. Now we want to do it for every startup.

Thank you.
