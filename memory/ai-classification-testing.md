# ai classification testing implementation

## overview
comprehensive test suite for ai classification rules functionality in the inbox system, covering auto-approve, auto-dismiss, and auto-mark as seen operations.

## test files created

### 1. classification-rules.test.ts
unit tests for the classification service focusing on:
- **auto-approve rules**: tests for trusted vendors and amount thresholds
- **auto-dismiss rules**: tests for spam/promotional content filtering  
- **auto-mark as seen rules**: tests for small receipts and routine documents
- **multiple rule matching**: tests for complex scenarios with multiple rules
- **card status updates**: tests for proper application of classification results
- **error handling**: tests for graceful failure scenarios

### 2. classification-integration.test.ts
integration tests covering end-to-end flows:
- email processing → classification → card updates
- real-world scenarios like invoice approval, promotional dismissal, receipt processing
- complex rule interactions with priorities
- multiple actions from single rules

## key test scenarios

### auto-approve
- invoices from trusted vendors under threshold amounts
- recurring subscriptions from known providers
- pre-approved expense categories

### auto-dismiss
- promotional emails and marketing content
- spam detection
- non-financial documents

### auto-mark as seen
- small receipts under configurable thresholds
- routine notifications
- informational documents

## classification service enhancements

### new action types added
- `dismiss`: automatically dismiss cards
- `mark_seen`: mark cards as seen without further action

### updated applyClassificationToCard function
- handles dismiss actions (sets status to 'dismissed')
- handles mark_seen actions (sets status to 'seen')
- properly prioritizes actions (dismiss > mark_seen > approve)
- maintains all other functionality (categories, expenses, payment status)

## testing approach

### mocking strategy
- mocked database queries for classification rules
- mocked ai sdk responses for document processing
- controlled test data for predictable results

### coverage
- 15 total tests across both files
- all tests passing
- covers happy paths and error scenarios
- tests rule priorities and conflicts

## usage

run tests with:
```bash
pnpm test classification
```

or individually:
```bash
pnpm test classification-rules.test.ts
pnpm test classification-integration.test.ts
```

## future improvements

1. add tests for:
   - rule creation/update/deletion
   - bulk classification operations
   - performance with many rules

2. integration with real ai models:
   - test actual openai responses
   - validate classification accuracy

3. ui testing:
   - test classification rule configuration ui
   - test visual feedback for auto-processed cards
