# Auto-Earn Implementation Status

## Completed Features

### 1. Cronjob Setup (✅ DONE)
- Updated `vercel.json` to run auto-earn worker every 15 minutes (`*/15 * * * *`)
- Created new API endpoint `/api/cron/auto-earn` that executes the worker script
- Removed old `/api/auto-earn-tick` endpoint

### 2. Earnings Display (✅ DONE - FIXED)
- **Savings Panel** (`/dashboard/savings`):
  - Added total saved amount display
  - Added total earned amount display (calculated from vault yield)
  - Shows earnings in a grid layout with clear visual distinction
  - Added "Advanced Settings" link for power users
  
- **Main Dashboard** (`/dashboard`):
  - Added `EarningsCard` component that shows auto-earn status
  - Displays total saved and total earned amounts
  - Shows auto-earn percentage when enabled
  - Card appears when auto-earn is enabled (even with $0 balance)
  - Includes "Manage Savings" button to navigate to savings page

### 3. Withdrawal Functionality (✅ DONE)
- Added "Withdraw" button in savings panel when rule is active and vault has balance
- Button navigates to `/dashboard/tools/earn-module` where full withdrawal UI exists
- Withdrawal uses existing `WithdrawEarnCard` component with proper vault integration
- Advanced settings link added for users who need more control

## Current Implementation Details

### Balance-Based Approach (Kept as requested)
- Worker checks USDC balance every 15 minutes
- Compares current balance to last checked balance
- If balance increased, allocates configured percentage to vault
- Stores deposit history with percentage used at time of deposit

### Data Flow
1. **Auto-Earn Worker** (`scripts/auto-earn-worker.ts`):
   - Runs every 15 minutes via cron
   - Checks balance changes
   - Executes auto-earn transfers
   - Records deposits in `earnDeposits` table

2. **Earnings Calculation**:
   - Uses `trpc.earn.stats` to fetch vault statistics
   - Calculates yield as `currentAssets - principal`
   - Displays in UI components

3. **Withdrawal Process**:
   - User clicks "Withdraw" in savings panel
   - Redirects to earn module page
   - Uses existing withdrawal infrastructure

## UI/UX Improvements
- EarningsCard shows when auto-earn is enabled (not just when deposits exist)
- Clear navigation between simple savings panel and advanced earn module
- Consistent experience across dashboard and savings pages
- Recent transactions display improved formatting

## Future Improvements (Not implemented)
- Transaction-based approach instead of balance-based
- Real-time deposit tracking
- Tax reporting features
