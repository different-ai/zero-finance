## Current Implementation Details

### Balance-Based Approach (Kept as requested)
- Worker checks USDC balance every 15 minutes
- Compares current balance to last checked balance
- If balance increased, allocates configured percentage to vault
- Stores deposit history with percentage used at time of deposit

### Data Flow
1. **Auto-Earn Worker** (`scripts/auto-earn-worker.ts`):
   - Runs every 15 minutes via cron
   - Checks balance changes
   - Executes auto-earn transfers
   - Records deposits in `earnDeposits` table

2. **Earnings Calculation**:
   - Uses `trpc.earn.stats` to fetch vault statistics
   - Calculates yield as `currentAssets - principal`
   - Displays in beautiful stat cards

3. **Withdrawal Process**:
   - User clicks Withdraw tab in savings page
   - Uses integrated WithdrawEarnCard component
   - Processes through Safe wallet
