# Mock Data - Inbox Feature Token Gating

## Overview
Created mock data for the token-gated inbox feature implementation. This mock data is used in the InboxMock component to show users what the inbox feature would look like before they purchase access.

## Mock Data Created

### Location: `packages/web/src/components/inbox/inbox-mock.tsx`

### Mock Invoice/Receipt Cards
```javascript
const mockInboxCards = [
  {
    id: '1',
    title: 'Monthly Software Invoice',
    subtitle: 'Adobe Creative Cloud',
    amount: '$52.99',
    confidence: 95,
    status: 'pending',
    timestamp: '2 hours ago',
    type: 'invoice',
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    title: 'Office Supplies Receipt',
    subtitle: 'Staples Order #12345',
    amount: '$127.43',
    confidence: 88,
    status: 'pending',
    timestamp: '1 day ago',
    type: 'receipt',
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    title: 'Utility Bill',
    subtitle: 'Electric Company',
    amount: '$89.20',
    confidence: 92,
    status: 'processed',
    timestamp: '3 days ago',
    type: 'bill',
  },
];
```

### Mock Statistics
- Pending Items: 12 (blurred)

- Accuracy: 94% (blurred)

- Bulk Actions
- Export & Reports

## What Needs to be Replaced

### âœ… Tasks to Remove Mock Data:
1. **Remove InboxMock component** once the feature gating is no longer needed
2. **Replace mock cards** with real user data from the actual inbox system
3. **Replace mock statistics** with real user metrics
4. **Update feature activation flow** to use real purchase validation instead of manual activation

### Files to Clean Up:
- `/packages/web/src/components/inbox/inbox-mock.tsx` - Delete entire file
- `/packages/web/src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/activate-feature/test/page.tsx` - Delete test page
- Update `/packages/web/src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/inbox/page.tsx` to remove mock component import and feature gating logic

### Real Data Sources:
- Cards: Should come from `api.inboxCards.getUserCards.useQuery()`
- Statistics: Should come from `api.inboxCards.getStats.useQuery()`
- Feature access: Keep the real feature access system but remove manual activation

## Implementation Status
- âœ… Database schema for user features
- âœ… tRPC procedures for feature management
- âœ… Mock inbox component
- âœ… Feature activation page
- âœ… Integration with existing inbox page
- âœ… Polar.sh purchase link integration
- ðŸ”„ Real purchase validation (needs Polar webhook setup)
- ðŸ”„ Production feature activation flow

## Security Notes
The current implementation uses a simple page redirect for activation which is insecure. In production, this should be replaced with:
1. Polar.sh webhook validation
2. Cryptographic purchase verification
3. Server-side activation only

## Next Steps
1. Set up Polar.sh webhook to automatically activate features upon purchase
2. Remove test activation page
3. Add proper error handling for failed activations
4. Implement feature expiration logic if needed
