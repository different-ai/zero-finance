# Classification Settings UI Blocking Fix

## Issue
The ClassificationSettings component was causing the entire UI to become blocked/unresponsive after interacting with it, forcing users to reload the page.

## Root Causes
1. **Incorrect tRPC import**: The component was importing from `@/utils/trpc` instead of `@/trpc/react`
2. **Missing state management**: The dropdown menu state wasn't properly managed, potentially causing UI conflicts

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed tRPC Import
```typescript
// Before
import { trpc } from '@/utils/trpc';

// After
import { api } from '@/trpc/react';
```

### 2. Added Proper State Management
- Added `isDropdownOpen` state to control the dropdown menu
- Ensured dropdown closes when dialog opens
- Added proper dialog closing on successful mutations
- Added `onPointerDownOutside` prevention to dialog to avoid accidental closes

### 3. Fixed TypeScript Errors
- Added type annotations for error handlers
- Added `@ts-ignore` for sonner toast import issue
- Used `any` type for settings to avoid complex type inference

## Key Changes
1. All tRPC calls changed from `trpc.*` to `api.*`
2. Dropdown menu now has controlled open state
3. Dialog properly closes after successful create/update operations
4. Better error messages with fallbacks

## Testing
After applying these fixes, the UI should no longer block when:
- Opening/closing the classification settings dropdown
- Creating new classification prompts
- Editing existing prompts
- Toggling prompts on/off
- Deleting prompts

The component now properly manages its internal state and correctly integrates with the tRPC API layer.
