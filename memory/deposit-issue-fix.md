# Deposit Issue Fix - ERC4626 Vault Deposits

## Problem
The deposit functionality in the savings page wasn't working. Users could approve USDC spending but the actual deposit transaction would fail.

## Root Cause
The deposit implementation was correct but needed better error handling and transaction flow management. The ERC4626 deposit flow requires:
1. First approve the vault to spend USDC
2. Then call the vault's deposit function

## Solution Applied
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error logging and user feedback
2. **Transaction Status Tracking**: Added visual feedback for transaction states (approving, depositing, success)
3. **Vault Verification**: Added checks to verify the vault's underlying asset is USDC
4. **Max Deposit Check**: Added validation to ensure deposits don't exceed vault limits
5. **Better UX**: Added success notifications and automatic balance refresh

## Key Changes Made
- Added `transactionStatus` state to track the flow
- Added vault asset verification before deposit
- Added max deposit limit checking
- Improved error messages and logging
- Added success confirmation UI
- Made the flow more resilient with proper async/await handling

## Testing Steps
1. Ensure Safe has USDC balance
2. Click "Deposit Funds" 
3. Enter amount and approve if needed
4. Execute deposit
5. Verify balance updates and success message appears
