# Deposit Issue Fix - ERC4626 Vault Deposits

## Problem
The deposit functionality in the savings page wasn't working. Users could approve USDC spending but the actual deposit transaction would fail.

## Root Cause
The deposit implementation needed several improvements:
1. Gas limits were too low for Safe transactions
2. Missing allowance verification before deposit attempts
3. Insufficient error handling for specific failure cases
4. Transaction timing issues

## Solution Applied
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error logging and user feedback
2. **Transaction Status Tracking**: Added visual feedback for transaction states (approving, depositing, success)
3. **Vault Verification**: Added checks to verify the vault's underlying asset is USDC
4. **Max Deposit Check**: Added validation to ensure deposits don't exceed vault limits
5. **Better UX**: Added success notifications and automatic balance refresh
6. **Gas Optimization**: Increased gas limits for both approval (300k) and deposit (500k) transactions
7. **Allowance Double-Check**: Added verification of allowance before attempting deposit
8. **Improved Error Messages**: Added specific error handling for common failure cases

## Key Changes Made
- Added `transactionStatus` state to track the flow
- Added vault asset verification before deposit
- Added max deposit limit checking
- Improved error messages and logging
- Added success confirmation UI
- Made the flow more resilient with proper async/await handling
- Increased gas limits for Safe transactions
- Added allowance double-checking before deposits
- Extended wait times for transaction mining (7 seconds)
- Added current allowance display in the UI

## Testing Steps
1. Ensure Safe has USDC balance
2. Click "Deposit Funds" 
3. Enter amount and approve if needed
4. Execute deposit
5. Verify balance updates and success message appears
6. Check console logs for detailed transaction information

## Common Issues and Solutions
- **"Transaction failed"**: Usually means gas limit is too low or Safe doesn't have enough ETH for gas
- **"Insufficient allowance"**: Need to approve the vault first
- **"Execution reverted"**: Check USDC balance and ensure amount is valid
