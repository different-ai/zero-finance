# Mock Data - Pay Functionality

## Current State
The pay functionality now extracts bank details from invoices but there are some areas that need improvement:

### What's Working
1. Raw text content is now preserved in the database (rawTextContent field)
2. Extraction prompt prioritizes raw text for finding bank details
3. UI shows extraction progress and results clearly
4. Bank lookup function uses AI to identify banks from routing numbers

### What Needs Improvement
1. **Bank Name Lookup**: Currently using AI text generation which may not be reliable
   - Should integrate with a proper bank routing number API
   - Or maintain a comprehensive database of routing numbers
   
2. **Web Search Integration**: The original request asked for web search to find bank names
   - This is not currently implemented due to limitations in the AI SDK
   - Would need to integrate a web search API or service
   
3. **Raw Text Preservation**: While we save raw text for new cards, existing cards don't have this data
   - Need a migration script to re-process existing cards
   - Or fetch raw text on-demand when needed

### Test Case
The user tested with an invoice containing:
```
redwood router services inc.
ADDRESS: 575 7th St, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA
CONTACT: billing@redwoodrouter.com â€¢ +1 (415) 555-0123
INVOICE # 2025-0711
...
please remit payment via ach bank: first republic bank 
routing: 321081669
account: 1420098765
```

The system should now extract:
- Bank: First Republic Bank
- Routing: 321081669
- Account: 1420098765

## Next Steps
1. Test the updated functionality with the invoice drop
2. Consider adding a proper bank routing number database
3. Implement web search if needed for unknown routing numbers
4. Add unit tests for the extraction logic
