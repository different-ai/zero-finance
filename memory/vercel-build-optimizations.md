# Vercel Build Optimizations

## Summary
Implemented aggressive build optimizations to reduce Vercel deploy time from 6-7 minutes to target 2-3 minutes (50-60% reduction).

## Key Optimizations Applied

### 1. TypeScript Checking Elimination (Biggest Impact)
- **Problem**: TypeScript checking was taking 3 minutes 46 seconds (biggest bottleneck)
- **Solution**: Skip TypeScript checking during Vercel builds, run separately in GitHub Actions
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `SKIP_TYPE_CHECK` environment variable
  - Modified `next.config.js` to skip TS checking when flag is set
  - Created separate GitHub Actions workflow for type checking
  - Expected time savings: **~3.5 minutes**

### 2. Build Script Optimization
- **Problem**: Sequential migration + build process
- **Solution**: 
  - Skip migrations for preview deployments
  - Increase Node.js memory allocation to 6GB
  - Use optimized build command
  - Expected time savings: **~30 seconds**

### 3. Webpack Optimizations
- **Problem**: Slow compilation and large bundle processing
- **Solution**:
  - Disabled source maps in production
  - Optimized chunk splitting with smaller max sizes
  - Parallel processing for minification
  - Disabled webpack cache in CI
  - Expected time savings: **~45 seconds**

### 4. Dependency Installation Optimization
- **Problem**: Slow package installation and workspace linting
- **Solution**:
  - Added `--prefer-offline` flag
  - Skip sherif workspace linting in CI
  - Fixed package.json structure warnings
  - Expected time savings: **~15 seconds**

### 5. Vercel Configuration
- **Problem**: Default build settings not optimized
- **Solution**:
  - Use optimized build command
  - Faster installation command
  - Expected time savings: **~10 seconds**

## Expected Results
- **Before**: 6-7 minutes
- **After**: 2-3 minutes
- **Reduction**: ~60-70%

## Trade-offs
- Type checking moved to GitHub Actions (still maintains type safety)
- Preview deployments skip migrations (acceptable for preview environments)
- Source maps disabled in production (can re-enable if needed for debugging)

## Monitoring
- Watch build logs for actual time improvements
- Monitor GitHub Actions for type checking results
- Ensure no functionality is broken by optimizations
