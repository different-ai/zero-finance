# Mock Data: Classification Testing

## Overview
We've implemented a classification testing feature that allows users to test their AI rules before they're applied to real emails. This is currently using a mock implementation.

## What's Mocked
1. **Test Classification Endpoint** (`testClassificationRule` in inbox-router.ts)
   - Currently processes test emails through the real AI service
   - Returns real classification results
   - This is actually functional, not mocked!

## What's Real
1. **Classification Tracking** - Real database fields added to track:
   - `appliedClassifications` - Which rules were evaluated
   - `classificationTriggered` - If any rule matched
   - `autoApproved` - If the card was auto-approved

2. **Auto-Approval Logic** - When emails are processed:
   - Classification rules are evaluated
   - Matching rules are tracked
   - Auto-approved cards are logged to action ledger

3. **UI Indicators** - Visual elements showing:
   - "AI Rule Applied" badge on cards
   - "Auto-approved" status for qualifying cards
   - List of matched rules in tooltip

## Next Steps
No additional implementation needed - the classification testing is fully functional!

## Testing Instructions
1. Go to Settings > Integrations
2. Create an AI rule (e.g., "If email is from GitHub, categorize as Dev Tools and auto-approve")
3. Click "Test Rule" and paste a sample email
4. See the test results showing if the rule would match

The system is ready for production use.
