# Milestones & Strategy

The core strategy is thought of in multiple phases. The first phase is to prove the core product. The second phase is to scale through distribution leverage. The third phase is to make the platform the primary revenue driver. Today, the product is in th efirst phase. It's bundling of 4 pieces:
- Yields through DeFi vaults
- Safety through insurance: Insurance coverage
- Great UX through Seamless On/offramp + embedded wallets.

The product today is just a thin layer on top of the core pieces. We need to build the platform layer on top of the core pieces.


In the immediate short-term our next milestone is to prove the core revenue model. To do this we believe we'll need to:
- Access to yield needs to be expanded to make sure we can get more attractive yields
- The safety needs to be expanded to go beyond insurance starting with diversicition across vaults.
- UX get improved through adding quality of life features like auto-sweep and cards to make sure that a) users adopt us easiliy alongside their existing banking habits and b) we can get more usage and stickiness eventually.

That's our next iteration technical:
- Multi-chain deployment (expand beyond Base to Ethereum, Arbitrum for better yields and diversification)
- Cards infrastructure live (partnership with existing provider like Gnosis Pay or Rain)
- Auto-sweep functionality with Plaid integration (automatic cash flow management between checking and savings)
- Multi-vault diversification begins (expand beyond Morpho to Aave)

On the distribution side we're planning on activating some partnerships with existing conversations we had with accelerators and other partners + double down on the IRL tactics we've been using like crashing demo days and guerrilla marketing at SF Tech Week.

We expect to reach the milestone of $2.5M ARR in 12 months with these strategies but it's not enough.

To go further we see our next milestone as being the platform phase. At this point we're the Stripe/Plaid for high-yield savings.

That's why another technical milestone wll be to cheap a very simple api layer that will allow any fintech to offer our yields and insurance coverage. To get adoption there we believe we have two levers:
1. Increase AUM of our core product, increases trust which increases the chance to resell the api to other players. 
2. Double down on sales to get the api partners.


The goal is to get to $25M ARR in 24 months with these strategies.

## Strategy to Achieve Milestones

**Phase 1: Prove the Core Product (Months 0-12)**

We're building the Mercury of DeFi yields. Focus is proving that startups will actually use this:

**GTM Approach:**
- Founder-led sales targeting crypto-native and AI startups ($3-5M seed rounds)
- IRL tactics that already work: crashing demo days, guerrilla marketing at SF Tech Week, working accelerator spaces
- Content marketing: "We Love Your Startup" series generating 20% of pipeline
- Accelerator partnerships: OrangeDAO making us default for portfolio companies, residence.xyz inbound

**Product Focus:**
- Perfect the core: 8% insured savings with Mercury-like UX
- Ship auto-sweep (2-3 months): automatic movement between checking and yield
- Launch cards (2-3 months): increase stickiness, not primary GTM message
- Build for retention: once we own cash flow automation + spending, switching costs spike

**Why this works:** We closed $2M in commitments in 10 weeks while building the product and fundraising. Capital unlocks both founders back to customer acquisition (6-8 companies/week vs current 2/week split between fundraising and product).

**Phase 2: Scale Through Distribution Leverage (Months 12-24)**

**Embedded partnerships:**
- Accelerators embed us as infrastructure (YC, Techstars portfolio companies get high-yield accounts as perk)
- Accounting/invoicing platforms (QuickBooks, Xero, Request Network integrations)
- Payroll providers (Rippling, Gusto) offer yield on pre-funded balances
- Mercury/Brex competitors white-label our yield layer

**API Product:**
- Any fintech can offer 8% insured yields without building DeFi integration, negotiating insurance, or handling compliance
- Revenue model: 15-20% of yield generated by partners (vs 10% we take direct)
- Faster growth, higher margin, no direct customer acquisition cost

**Technical moat:**
- Insurance relationships take 6-9 months to establish (first-mover advantage window)
- Vault curation expertise compounds over time
- Self-custodial architecture + compliance framework = differentiated offering

**Phase 3: Platform Becomes Primary Revenue (Months 24-36)**

At this stage, we're the Stripe/Plaid for high-yield savings:

- 3-5 major fintech partners each managing $500M-$1B through our infrastructure
- White-label insurance coverage that scales with partner AUM
- Multi-chain, multi-protocol yield optimization that no single fintech wants to build
- Network effects: more AUM = better rates with money markets and insurers = better product = more partners

**Why this is defensible:**
- We built infrastructure products at Gnosis Pay ($75M transaction volume) - we know how to abstract DeFi into reliable APIs
- First-mover on insurance partnerships creates structural advantage
- AUM scale gives us negotiating leverage (rates, insurance pricing) that competitors can't match
- Self-custody architecture + proven compliance playbook = hard to replicate

**Distribution Evolution:**

**Months 0-12:**
- 100% direct founder-led sales
- Target: $200M AUM from 1,000 startups

**Months 12-24:**
- 60% direct, 40% embedded partnerships
- Accelerators, accounting platforms, early API partners
- Target: $1B AUM

**Months 24-36:**
- 30% direct (enterprises), 70% platform/API
- Major neobanks and expense platforms white-label our infrastructure
- Target: $2B AUM

**Key Hiring Milestones:**

**Month 3-6:** Growth hire (IRL tactics, accelerator partnerships)
**Month 6-9:** 2 engineers (ship auto-sweep, cards, API beta)
**Month 9-12:** Compliance/ops (close Stripe Atlas, Mercury partnerships)
**Month 12-18:** Senior blockchain engineer (custom smart contracts)
**Month 18-24:** Head of Partnerships (API platform GTM)
**Month 24+:** Enterprise sales, institutional compliance team
