Hey Sameer, Louis—wanted to connect you two!

Louis (Mediar.ai) just raised $3M and is building AI agents that automate manual data entry into legacy systems like SAP, ERPs, and Oracle. He's specifically looking to connect with CFOs or leaders at companies with teams that manually do data entry into legacy systems.

Sameer (is helping Seafarer Consulting) runs fractional bookkeeping, accounting, and CFO services. From our conversation back in July, I know you're actively exploring AI agents to streamline workflows and offer more real-time reporting for your clients. Your team handles a lot of manual categorization and reconciliation work.

Sameer, you mentioned wanting to leverage AI to streamline workflows when we first connected. Louis's tool learns by observing workflows and automates repetitive data entry tasks—could be exactly what you were looking for in our pilot discussions. Louis, Seafarer works with exactly the types of businesses (startups, SMBs) that manually do data entry and could benefit from automation.

Think there's real synergy here. Worth exploring together.
