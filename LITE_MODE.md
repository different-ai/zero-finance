## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Privy Smart Wallet Setup

**Before running the app**, you need to configure smart wallets in your Privy dashboard:

1. **Go to your Privy Dashboard**: https://dashboard.privy.io
2. **Navigate to**: Wallets ‚Üí Smart Wallets
3. **Enable Smart Wallets** and configure:
   - **Chain**: Base (8453)
   - **Smart Account Type**: Safe
   - **Paymaster**: Choose "None" for lite mode (users pay gas)
   - Or configure a paymaster for gasless transactions

Without this setup, users won't be able to create wallets in the app.
